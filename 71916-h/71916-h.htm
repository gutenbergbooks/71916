<h3 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h3>

<p>It is one of the venerable commonplaces of criticism
that ‘manners,’ as distinct from romance and the
idealistic interpretation of life, make the bulk of
eighteenth century literature. Comment has often
begun and more often ended with this platitude. But
that large body of work vaguely termed ‘literature
of manners’ can no more be dismissed with a truism
than can the life that it depicts, but demands a critical
method as varied as the matter which is treated. In
so far as this prevailing interest of the century manifested
itself in <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>, in novel, drama, satire,
and descriptive verse, it offers no unusual problem
to the literary historian; but side by side with such
types we have forms no less characteristic of the age,
but much less susceptible of adequate criticism: intimate
biography, autobiography, memoirs, diaries,
and familiar correspondence. These must of necessity
be rather summarily passed over by the literary historian
as not exclusively belletristic in appeal. And
below these, in turn, there are certain expressions of
the social spirit so anomalous that they can at most
detain the critic but a moment, and must often be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
dismissed with no consideration at all. Among these,
intangible and evanescent by nature, yet of the first
importance in bringing certain kinds of literature to
birth, are conversation, the salon, the authors’ club,
and in general those forms of social activity which
exist to stimulate the production or diffuse the appreciation
of literature. These, which are in themselves
no more literature than are painting and politics,
come at times so close to it that dividing lines are
blurred. A mere record of conversation, such as gives
the pages of Boswell’s <cite>Johnson</cite> or Fanny Burney’s
<cite>Diary</cite> their unique value, brings us to a borderland
between society and letters where a distinction between
them is merely formal. What is a critic to do
with works which hardly sue for recognition as literature
(though the world has so acclaimed them), but
avowedly exist to record the delights of social intercourse?
To treat them as ‘mere literature,’ neglecting
the social life in which they sprang up and to which
they are a tribute, is, to say the least, inadequate.</p>

<p>It is with this borderland, this territory where
literature and society meet in mutual respect, and
presumably to their mutual advantage, that I propose
to deal in this volume. I shall trace as well as I can
the attempt made in England between 1760 and 1790
to emulate the literary world of Paris by bringing men
of letters and men of the world into closer relations,
and by making the things of the mind an avocation
of the drawing-room; and thereafter I shall endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to show the results of this movement as they appear
in the improved artistry of three or four types of
writing.</p>

<p>So long as letters and society retained this intimate
relation and men and manners were deemed the all-sufficient
study of poets, it was natural that authors
should gather in the metropolis. The city was to
them ‘the true scene for a man of letters’; ‘the
fountain of intelligence and pleasure,’ the place for
‘splendid society,’ and the place where ‘a man stored
his mind better than anywhere else.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> When the
old ideal of letters was displaced by a wider and perhaps
nobler, the supremacy of the metropolis as a
literary centre fell with it; but in the Age of Johnson
London was still the land of promise, at once a workshop
and a club, a discipline and an opportunity.
‘A great city is, to be sure,’ said Johnson, ‘the
school for studying life.’ Johnson, Goldsmith, Burke,
Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Sheridan, Beattie, Chatterton,
Crabbe, Boswell, and many another went up
thither, as their predecessors for generations had done,
to seek their literary fortune or to enjoy their new-established
fame.</p>

<p>The authors’ clubs, hardly less popular than in the
days of Anne, indicate an even closer centralization.
A theory of literature squarely based on reason and the
tradition of the classics produced a solidarity of sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
among men of letters which was of great use in
making their aims intelligible to society at large.
Books were not meant to be caviare to the general.
Poets did not strive to be nebulous. The ever growing
democracy of readers honoured what it felt that it
understood. King, Church, women of society, women
of no society, painters, actors, and universities joined
in paying respect to a literature that had not yet shattered
into the confusion of individualism. The world
of letters was, in a word, still a kingdom.</p>

<p>As in Paris, an alliance could, accordingly, be effected.
The salon was the natural outgrowth of the intelligent
interest of the reading world; it exhibited the same
community of sentiment in readers that we have
noticed in writers, and writers accordingly honoured
it. In London, as in Paris, it became possible to find
the men of light and leading gathered in a few places
of favourite resort, in drawing-room or club. ‘I will
venture to say,’ remarked Johnson<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to a group of
friends, ‘there is more learning and science within the
circumference of ten miles from where we now sit than
in all the rest of the Kingdom;’ and once, when the
boasting fit was on him, he asserted that the company
sitting with him round the table was superior to any
that could be got together even in Paris.</p>

<p>It was no mean ideal of society that was held by
groups such as these. Mere repartee, a display of
rhetorical agility, was not its principal aim. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
desire to be sound mingled with the desire to be clever,
and produced that wisdom which the eighteenth century
loved to call wit. Wit was aphoristically pretentious
to truth. It was of course important to talk in
the <i lang="fr">mondaine</i> manner, but the <i lang="fr">mondaine</i> ideal was to
talk sense. There was a general willingness to give
and to receive information in the ordinary social relations
of life. Never to ‘diffuse information,’ to have
‘nothing conclusive’ in one’s talk, was to fail. Johnson
once contended that Goldsmith was not ‘a social
man’: ‘he never exchanged <em>mind</em> with you.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Burke’s
conversation, on the other hand, delighted him because
it was the ebullition of a full mind.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ‘The man who
talks to unburthen his mind is the man to delight you,’
said he.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Cheerful familiarity was not the social ideal:
true sociability was a communion of minds. Madame
du Deffand summed up her criticism of a dinner at
Madame Necker’s in the words, ‘I learned nothing
there.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It was to an ideal thus frankly educational that the
salon and the club responded. The passion for such
society was like that which many serious souls to-day
feel for the society of a university. To breathe the
air of it was to grow in the grace of wisdom. In such
an idealization of the social life, we may find the
explanation of many so-called ‘deficiencies’ of the age,
its indifference to Nature (whatever that may mean),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
its preference for city life, its common sense, its dread
of the romantic and the imaginary, and of all that
seems to repudiate the intellectual life and its social
expression.</p>

<p>Such was the delight in society felt by Hannah More
and Fanny Burney in their younger days. Such was
Boswell’s delight. The greatness of the latter, so
ridiculously aspersed, reposes entirely upon his realization
of the importance of the social instinct. Boswell
was not merely a social ‘climber.’ He was a man who
had the sense to see a short-cut to education. To call
him toad and tuft-hunter may be an ingenious display
of one’s vituperative gifts, but evinces a surprising
ignorance of the fact that a man may educate himself
by living contact with great minds.</p>

<p>It would be a simple explanation of all this respect
for the salon and its discussions to observe that England
was now enjoying an age of free speech. It is even
simpler to point out that there was much discussion
because there was much to discuss. There were problems
confronting the public which were no less important
than novel. This is all true, but somewhat
lacking in subtlety. The peculiar adaptability of these
problems to conversation was due to the fact that they
were, in general, still problems of a remote and idealistic
kind. They did not yet demand instant solution,
for better or for worse. Exception must of course be
made of questions purely political, but the rest of them—the
theory of equality and the republican form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
government, the development of machinery, the education
of the masses, humanitarianism, the problem of
the dormant, self-satisfied, aristocratic Church, romanticism,
and the whole swarm of theories popularized
by Rousseau—had been stated and widely discussed,
but they had not yet shaken society to its foundations.
They were still largely theoretical. Men’s thoughts
were engaged, and their tongues were busy, but their
hearts were not yet failing them for fear.</p>

<p>We may cite as a significant example the position
of the lower classes. There had been as yet no serious
disturbance of what Boswell loved to call ‘the grand
scheme of subordination.’ Now Boswell was no fool.
He was, in truth, singularly broad-minded; yet in such
a matter as this his notions hardly rose above a benevolent
feudalism. Despite his interest in Rousseau,
despite his sympathy with Corsica and with America, he
could record with bland approval Johnson’s denunciation<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
of a young lady who had married with ‘her inferior
in rank,’ and the Great Moralist’s wish that such dereliction
‘should be punished, so as to deter others from
the same perversion.’ Democracy could be little more
than a theory to Johnson when he asserted<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that ‘if
he were a gentleman of landed property he would turn
out all his tenants who did not vote for the candidate
whom he supported,’ contending that ‘the law does
not mean that the privilege of voting should be independent
of old family interest.’ Again, when he explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
to Mrs. Macaulay ‘the absurdity of the levelling
doctrine’ by requesting her footman to sit down and
dine with them,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> he conceived of himself as smashing
a delusion with a single blow. Such ‘levelling’ notions
being, for the moment, doctrinaire, might no doubt be
put down by a sally of wit. With the fall of the Bastille
they took on a different aspect.</p>

<p>Nor was the case widely different with writers less
passionately conservative than Johnson. Horace Walpole
had a dim perception that the trend of affairs was
destructive of the old order, but he never suspected
that the theories discussed in the salons were to have
immediate practical results. His attitude is well shown
by his account of certain Parisian <i lang="fr">savants</i> who talked
scepticism in the presence of their lacqueys. ‘The
conversation,’ he writes, ‘was much more unrestrained,
even on the Old Testament, than I would suffer at my
own table in England, if a single footman was present.’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Walpole was certainly no ardent defender of the orthodox
faith, but sceptic as he was, he was not ready to
meet all the issues involved in the spread of the doctrine.
Religion, it seems, will still do very well for
menials.</p>

<p>Even Hume and Gibbon, the darlings of the Parisian
salon, conceived of the problems they themselves had
helped to raise as largely speculative. Gibbon, for
example, plumes himself on having vanquished the
Abbé Mably in a discussion of the republican form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
government<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>—and this but a few years before the
foundation of the two great republics of modern times.
The irony of his triumph must, presently, have been
clear to him, for on September 9, 1789, he wrote to
Sheffield: ‘What a scene is France! While the
assembly is voting abstract propositions, Paris is an
independent republic.’ In the previous August he had
expressed his amazement ‘at the French Revolution.’
We may perhaps reserve a portion of our amazement
for the historian who had failed to realize that the theories
with which he had been long familiar in the salons
would one day cease to be mere matters of discussion.</p>

<p>This failure of English authors to come into full
sympathy with the French doctrines of the hour is the
more remarkable because Frenchmen had long regarded
England as the home of reason and of liberty.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Indeed
France had turned to England for that ‘freedom of
thought’ denied to herself; but having adopted it, she
had pushed it to extremes of which her teachers, conservative
at heart, could never have conceived. D’Alembert,
than whom the salons contained no more splendid
figure, acknowledged in his <cite>Essay on Men of Letters</cite>
that it was the works of English authors which had
communicated to Frenchmen their precious liberty of
thought.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> So common is the praise of England that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
he now feels compelled to protest against the further
progress of Anglicism.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But in vain. The decades
passed by with no diminution of the respect for England.
In 1763 Gibbon<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> still found English opinions,
fashions, and games popular in Paris, every Englishman
treated as patriot and philosopher, and the very
name of England ‘<i lang="la">clarum et venerabile gentibus</i>.’ In
the next year Voltaire, who had done so much by judicious
praise and injudicious blame to spread the knowledge
of English literature and philosophy, addressed
to the <cite lang="fr">Gazette Littéraire</cite> a letter<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> containing a defence
of the current Anglomania. In this he laughed at
those who thought it a ‘crime’ to study, observe, and
philosophize as do the English. A year later, Saurin’s
play, <cite lang="fr">l’Anglomanie</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> had appeared, and though its
success on the stage was not great, Walpole thought it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
worth while to send Lady Hervey a copy of it as an
example of a reigning fad. The leading character,
Éraste, who affects a preference for Hogarth to all
other painters, who quotes Locke and Newton, and
drinks tea for breakfast, sums up his views in these
verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0">Les précepteurs du monde à Londres out pris naissance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">C’est d’eux qu’il faut prendre leçon.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Aussi je meurs d’impatience</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">D’y voyager. De par Newton</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Je le verrai, ce pays où l’on pense.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All this of course is farcical; but the author, a member
of the French Academy, had a serious purpose. He was
attacking an attitude which was expressed in Voltaire’s
well-known eulogy,</p>

<p class="pad3" lang="fr">Le soleil des Anglais, c’est le feu du génie.</p>

<p class="noindent">Saurin, in his preface, announces his esteem for England
and her authors, but declares that the popularity of the
‘cult’ is due to the jealous dislike by Frenchmen of
their own authors—a conclusion not quite obvious.
In any case, the academician felt that he had a duty to
the nation. In 1772 he revised his comedy, and it was
again performed.</p>

<p>But Anglomania lived on. English authors were
still graciously received in the salons. Madame du
Deffand dared to assert that they were completely
superior to the French in all matters of reasoning.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
The English language was increasingly studied, and
English novelists and philosophers continued popular.
Madame Necker records<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> an anecdote of a lady who
went to England ‘<span lang="fr">pour renouveler ses idées.</span>’ The lady
was perhaps fulfilling Montesquieu’s famous advice,
to travel in Germany, sojourn in Italy, and think in
England.</p>

<p>Anglomania was thus more than a passing fashion;
it was but the superficial evidence of a respect for
English philosophy of life which Frenchmen had taken
more seriously than had the English themselves. It
happened, as it has happened more than once, that
English literature was more highly esteemed abroad
than at home. ‘<span lang="fr">Nous avons augmenté,</span>’ said Madame
Necker to Gibbon,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> ‘<span lang="fr">jusque chez vous la célébrité de
vos propres auteurs.</span>’ English novels were read in
France for the new ideals of life which they were supposed
to embody, and much that in England was a
mere pastime—<cite>Clarissa</cite>, for example—became in
France a philosophy of conduct. <ins class="corr" id="tn-14" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'A philospher like'">
A philosopher like</ins> Hume, and a philosophical historian like Gibbon, found
that Paris delighted to honour the prophets whom England
was too careless to stone.</p>

<p>The pupil had thus outrun his master, and had indeed
become the master. In the earlier decades of the
century, Voltaire and Montesquieu had gone to England
to enjoy the privilege of thought: in the later decades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Englishmen visited Paris for a precisely similar
purpose. From the middle of the century until the
outbreak of war in 1778, Englishmen could discover in
the conversations of the salons what a nation, always
radical at heart, had made of the theories of free thought,
liberty, and equality before the law, which they had,
through Voltaire and Montesquieu, derived long since
from England. English authors were received with a
cordiality and a deference which had never been shown
them in their own country. They found in Paris a
social system conducted in honour of authors and of
the philosophies which they were disseminating. It
was the salon, the forcing-bed of the new ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="smcap">Origin and Characteristics of the Salon</span></h3>

<p>The one unfailing characteristic of the salon, in all
ages and in all countries, is the dominant position
which it gives to woman. It is woman who creates
the peculiar atmosphere and the peculiar influence of
salons; it is she, with her instinct for society and for
literature, who is most likely to succeed in the attempt
to fuse two ideals of life apparently opposed, the social
and the literary. The salon is not a mere drawing-room
and not a lonely study, but mediates between the
promiscuous chatter of the one and the remote silence
of the other. The aims of the salon are well shown
by the ridicule of those enemies who accuse the hostess
of attempting to transform a school of pedants and
hacks into a group of courtiers. The social world
is likely to laugh at the salon because it suggests the
lecture-hall, and scholars sneer at it because it pretends
to the distinction of a literary court.</p>

<p>The first salons were indeed courts—the courts of
the Italian Renaissance. We find in the Parisian
salons of later centuries the <i lang="la">disjecta membra</i> of this
earlier Italian society, whose true relationship is understood
only when we trace them back to this remote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
original. In the light of that Italian dawn, all leaps
into a consistent scheme. Much that seems odd and
unrelated in salon life is brought into perspective:
the authoritative position of the scholar, the unique
influence of woman, and the tendency to set up ‘Platonic’
relations between the sexes. Humanism, Platonism,
and gallantry were aspects of the Renaissance
and of the Italian Court, and in their lesser manifestations
as learning, philosophism, and ‘Platonic love,’
they remain characteristic of salons. Again, the
courts of the fifteenth century brought into focus many
movements: they carried on the mediæval system of
patronage; they adopted many of the gallantries of
the old ‘courts of love’; and they brought the new
humanism into vital contact with society, so that the
expression of serious thought was no less possible in
conversation than in the study or the lecture-hall.
Each of these lives on in the salon.</p>

<p>The Renaissance court may be studied in any one of
a numerous group. We may find the ideal set forth
in the group of artists and men of letters who surrounded
the youthful Beatrice d’Este, patroness of Leonardo
and many another; we may see it in the court of her
sister, Isabella, Marchioness of Mantua; we may see
it in the coterie of Caterina Cornaro, once Queen of
Cyprus, and in her later days mistress of a little court<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
at Asolo. We may study it at its grandest in the somewhat
earlier court of Lorenzo the Magnificent, with its
conscious imitation of the Greek symposium. The
court which held Politian, Pulci, Ficino the Platonist,
Alberti, and, later, Michelangelo, might well have
boasted itself ‘the little academe’ of <cite>Love’s Labour’s
Lost</cite>. But perhaps the most useful example is the
delightful court of Urbino, described by Castiglione
in his <cite lang="it">Cortegiano</cite>.</p>

<p>If it be objected that Castiglione’s description of
court life is too radiant to be quite true to fact, if it
be a society fairer than any whose existence can be
demonstrated, I reply that it is so much the better
suited to our purpose. It is ideals that we would be
at. We are spared the attempt to reconstruct them
for ourselves. There is nothing to be gained by reminding
ourselves that courts attracted the parasite,
the flatterer, and the opportunist; it is the finer aims
of the men of genius and of the noble women who
patronized them that will reward our attention. Castiglione
knew these aims, and we cannot do better than
quote his words as they were given to Elizabethan
England in Hoby’s beautiful translation.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The first
quotation refers to Frederick, first Duke of Urbino:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This man emong his other deedes praisworthy, in the
hard and sharpe situation of Urbin buylt a Palaice,
to the opinion of many men, the fayrest that was to be
founde in all Italy, and so fornished it with everye
necessary implement belonging thereto, that it appeared
not a palaice, but a Citye in fourme of a palaice,
and that not onlye with ordinarie matters, as Silver
plate, hanginges for chambers of verye riche cloth of
golde, of silke and other like, but also for sightlynesse:
and to decke it out withall, placed there a wonderous
number of auncyent ymages of marble and mettall,
verye excellente peinctinges and instrumentes of
musycke of all sortes, and nothinge would he have
there but what was moste rare and excellent. To this
with verye great charges he gathered together a great
number of most excellent and rare bookes, in Greke,
Latin and Hebrue, the which all he garnished wyth
golde and sylver, esteaming this to be the chieffest
ornament of his great palaice....</p>
</div>

<p>We turn now to the court of his son Guidobaldo,
who carried on the traditions of his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He sett hys delyte above all thynges to have hys
house furnished with most noble and valyaunte Gentylmen,
wyth whom he lyved very famylyarly, enjoying
theyr conversation wherein the pleasure whyche he
gave unto other menne was no lesse, then that he receyved
of other, because he was verye wel seene in
both tunges, and together with a lovynge behavyour
and plesauntnesse he had also accompanied the
knowleage of infinite thinges.... Because the Duke
used continuallye by reason of his infirmytye, soon
after supper to go to his rest, everye man ordinarelye,
at that houre drewe where the Dutchesse was, the Lady
Elizabeth Gonzaga. Where also continuallye was the
Lady Emilia Pia, who for that she was endowed with
so livelye a wytt and judgement as you knowe, seemed
the maistresse and ringe leader of all the companye,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and that everye manne at her receyved understandinge
and courage.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There was then to be hearde pleasaunte
communication and merye conceytes, and in every
mannes countenaunce a manne myght perceyve
peyncted a lovynge jocundenesse. So that thys house
truelye myght well be called the verye mansion place of
Myrth and Joye. And I beleave it was never so tasted
in other place, what maner a thynge the sweete conversation
is that is occasioned of an amyable and
lovynge companye, as it was once there.... But
such was the respect which we bore to the Dutchesse
wyll, that the selfe same libertye was a verye great
bridle. Neither was there anye that thought it not
the greatest pleasure he could have in the worlde, to
please her, and the greatest griefe to offende her. For
this respecte were there most honest condicions coupled
with wonderous greate libertye, and devises of pastimes
and laughinge matters tempred in her sight....
The maner of all the Gentilmen in the house was
immedyatelye after supper to assemble together where
the dutchesse was. Where emonge other recreations,
musicke, and dauncynge, whiche they used contynuallye,
sometyme they propounded feate questions,
otherwhyle they invented certayne wytty sportes
and pastimes, at the devyse sometyme of one sometyme
of an other, in the whych under sundrye covertes,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
often tymes the standers bye opened subtylly theyr
imaginations unto whom they thought beste. At
other tymes there arrose other disputations of divers
matters, or els jestinges with prompt inventions.
Manye times they fell into purposes,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> as we now a
dayes terme them, where in thys kynde of talke and
debating of matters, there was wonderous great pleasure
on all sydes: because (as I have sayde) the house
was replenyshed wyth most noble wyttes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Such conversational ‘pastimes’ were enjoyed almost
every night:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And the order thereof was such, that assoone as
they were assembled where the Dutches was, every
man satt him downe at his will, or as it fell to his lot,
in a circle together, and in sittinge were devyded a
man and a woman, as longe as there were women, for
alwayes (lightlye) the number of men was farr the
greater. Then were they governed as the Dutchesse
thought best, whiche manye times gave this charge
unto the L. Emilia.</p>
</div>

<p><cite lang="it">Il Cortegiano</cite> is the tribute paid to this group and
the conversation which passed in it. The spirit of
the book is not to be shown by a few quotations, but a
reading of it will reveal the following facts: that men
and women meet on a plane of equality, that it is the
presence of women (though fewer in number than the
men), that gives the peculiar tone of lightness and
gallantry; that the author looks to the court not only
for reward, but for inspiration; that the conversation
at its noblest (as in Bembo’s discourse at the end)
passes over into poetry; that the conversation is of a
classical and philosophic cast, often Platonic, but that
this high seriousness does not exclude mirth and wit.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Now these aims are no other than the aims of the
salon.</p>

<p>This ideal, diffused over Europe, had a long and
brilliant history. We shall encounter it again in the
courtly salons of Elizabethan England, and even in
the comedies of Shakespeare. The tradition passed
over into France and there became the formative influence
in the great type and parent of the Parisian
salon, the <span lang="fr">Hôtel de Rambouillet</span>.</p>

<p>In tracing the <span lang="fr">Hôtel de Rambouillet</span> back to the
earlier Italian court, two facts stand out as of first
importance. In the first place, that salon was established
by a woman who was herself half Italian, had
passed many years in Italy, and knew the traditions
of the old nobility. In the second place, the Hôtel
de Rambouillet originated in protest against the crudities
of the Gascon court at Paris, and represented an
attempt to realize a worthier society.</p>

<p>When, in the second decade of the seventeenth century,
Cathérine de Vivonne opened her famous house
in the Rue Saint Thomas du Louvre and initiated the
reign of good taste in France, her salon displayed almost
immediately certain aspects which had distinguished
the Italian courts and which were to become, in varying
degrees, permanent features of the Parisian salon and
of its London counterpart. The <span lang="fr">Marquise de Rambouillet</span>
became the type and exemplar of all the later
hostesses. Even the English bluestockings were aware
that they were in the line of descent from her. In her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
poem <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Hannah More compares the English
group with that which met in the <span lang="fr">Hôtel de Rambouillet</span>,
and Wraxall<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> later took up the comparison and developed
the parallel between the drawing-rooms of London
and those of Paris. The <span lang="fr">Hôtel de Rambouillet</span>,
therefore, is the type of the salon. It enables us to
distinguish what is permanent and common to all
salons, from what is merely transitory. For the sake
of convenience, I shall make a fivefold grouping of
these features. It will of course be understood that
this analysis does not afford a complete characterization
of the <span lang="fr">Hôtel de Rambouillet</span>; for that society
had certain important aims—such as the attempt to
purify the language—which were not destined to
remain permanent marks of the succeeding salons, and
are therefore passed over in silence. Nor must it be
assumed that the fivefold analysis describes each and
every later salon. A given salon may be entirely
lacking in one of the features—though never, I think,
in a majority of them—without losing its character;
and in proportion as a given salon satisfies these five
conditions, we may say that it approaches the ideal.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place, then, the house, the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
room, in which the company gathers, is influential in
forming its spirit and establishing its reputation. We
have just examined Castiglione’s description of the
magnificence of Urbino: something of that royal
splendour is demanded of the salon. It was Madame
de Rambouillet’s sense for architectural arrangement
and decoration that contributed to her social success.
Indeed the name by which her salon is known plainly
implies it. As is well known, she began by breaking
up the great reception-hall with its vast, unsocial
coldness into a series of smaller rooms and alcoves,
thus providing for the intimacies of conversation as
distinct from the hubbub and the crowd. Her own
favourite room, the <i lang="fr">chambre bleu d’Arthénice</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> where a
privileged few—at most eighteen—sat by her couch,
was the centre and soul of the house. It was the
perfumed temple of the Graces, where the year was
always at spring, the haunt of Flora, and the throne
of Athena herself. This room reproduced itself in
countless ‘alcoves,’ ‘blue rooms,’ and <i lang="fr">ruelles</i> throughout
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Madame
de Boufflers was famous for her apartments hung with
rose-coloured damask, and Madame Geoffrin for her
house, which was crammed with rare china and bronzes,
portraits by Boucher, and easel-pictures by Van Loo.</p>

<p>(2) The salon must retain an aristocratic tone, but
without submitting to the unyielding formality of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
aristocracy. It sets up a standard of recognition based
on talent,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and neither courts nor rejects the nobility.
It was even possible for the bourgeois to obtain admission
to the <span lang="fr">Hôtel de Rambouillet</span> and to have a
career there. Vincent Voiture, known as ‘Chiquito,’
the son of a wine-merchant, became the leading spirit
in all the amusements. His position reminds us now
of the mediæval jester, now of Beau Nash, the King
of Bath.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century the salons are proud to
represent a democracy of genius. Madame Geoffrin
was the daughter of a <i lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> and the wife of a
manufacturer; Madame Necker was the daughter of
a Swiss parson; and Mlle. de Lespinasse, a foundling,
who had been ‘humble companion’ to Madame du
Deffand, and who had not means sufficient to entertain
her guests at dinner. Wit, intellect, and personality,
rather than noble birth, became the key to social
success.</p>

<p>(3) The chief staple of entertainment offered by
the salons is conversation, literary or philosophical in
character. Other amusements, such as Castiglione
describes at Urbino, are not necessarily excluded, and,
in France, dancing, excursions, card-playing, and
gaming were popular in various salons and at various
times. But conversation always reasserted itself in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the end. Discussion was stimulated by the reading
of original poems, essays, sermons, and plays. The
criticism of these, especially of the plays, was of no
mean importance in forming the spirit of French literature.
In particular the salon gives birth to certain
minor forms of literature, epistles, epigrams, extempore
verses of all kinds, ‘thoughts,’ maxims, <i lang="fr">bons mots</i>,
‘portraits,’ and <i lang="fr">éloges</i>;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but of more importance than
these is its unconscious formative influence on such
arts as letter-writing, biography, and all manner of
anecdotal writing.</p>

<p>(4) The friendships of the salon are of peculiar
depth and warmth, developing occasionally into passion,
but always Platonic rather than domestic in
their expression. Thus the salon, in which woman
assumes the throne, and queens it over a coterie (chiefly
men) is perhaps the last phase of the Italian court
with its gallantries and lady-worship. It passed on
to the French salon that note of sentiment and Platonic
love which is found in <cite lang="it">Il Cortegiano</cite>, and which
becomes characteristic of Sappho Scudéry and the
later seventeenth century. In the eighteenth century
this sentimental friendship united with the more practical
system of patronage, and resulted in a type of
relationship which eludes definition, for, on the one
hand, it is at times so utilitarian as to savour of philanthropy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and, on the other, it may develop into a
<i lang="fr">grande passion</i>, and compare itself to Abelard and
Héloïse. Examples of it are the various relations
existing between Madame Geoffrin and Marmontel,
Madame du Deffand and d’Alembert, Madame du
Deffand and Horace Walpole, Madame de Boufflers
and David Hume, Mlle. de Lespinasse and d’Alembert,
Mlle. de Lespinasse and Guibert, Madame Necker
and Edward Gibbon.</p>

<p>(5) The hostess of the salon is invariably the subject
of ideal descriptions, ‘tributes’ which recite her
charm as a hostess, her merits as a patron, and her
general superiority to the Muses. From Castiglione’s
eulogy of Elizabeth Gonzaga, through the Hôtel de
Rambouillet (where Malherbe was a kind of poet
laureate), down to the death of Mlle. de Lespinasse,
whose genius was celebrated by d’Alembert in the
<cite lang="fr">Tombeau de Mlle. de Lespinasse</cite>, this is an almost
unfailing result of salon life.</p>

<p>Such are, then, the permanent marks by which we
may detect that interplay of the social and the literary
life in what, for want of a better term, we call the
salon. There are two features of the life manifested
only at certain times which it is not proper to include,
though they are more generally attributed to the salons
than any that have been mentioned. They are transitory
phases; but they must be briefly considered, if
only by way of avoiding false assumptions.</p>

<p>The women of the salons are usually thought of as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
<i lang="fr">femmes savantes</i>, or ‘learned ladies,’ who affect a learning
which has no basis in fact. Such female pedants
were common figures in the salons of a certain period.
The depiction of them by Molière is no more exaggerated
than the purposes of comic art demand. It
must be further admitted that such women may appear
now and again in the salons of any period; we shall
meet with a few in the pages of this volume. But they
are not <em>common</em> in the best salons of the best periods.
Neither in the beginning, nor in the eighteenth century,
were the hostesses of the salon what we ordinarily
mean by the phrase <i lang="fr">femmes savantes</i>. Of Madame de
Rambouillet, for example, M. Vourciez writes:<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
‘<span lang="fr">Ce sont les aliments les plus solides qu’elle digérait
sans prétention à devenir une “femme savante,” car
Balzac eût pu lui adresser à elle aussi le compliment
qu’il fit à Madame des Loges: “Vous savez une
infinité de choses rares, mais vous n’en faites pas la
savante, et ne les avez pas apprises pour tenir école.”</span>’
As for the women of the next century, they assisted
their friends chiefly by qualities which have little to do
with book-learning, by superb intelligence, wit, sympathy,
and good taste. They made no pretence to erudition.
Indeed they rather piqued themselves on their
ignorance of it. To mistake Madame Geoffrin, who
said she could not spell, and Madame du Deffand,
who was bored by a <i lang="fr">savant</i>, for a woman like Armande<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
or Bélise is to have done with all distinctions at once.
It is to confound Prospero with Polonius.</p>

<p>It is no less true that the women of the salons were
not permanently <i lang="fr">précieuses ridicules</i>. Preciosity had
its day; it did its work (which was by no means contemptible);
and it was laughed out of existence.
There were no <i lang="fr">précieuses</i> in 1750. Indeed the caustic
penetration of Madame du Deffand,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the homely wit
of Madame Geoffrin, and the romantic ardour of Mlle.
de Lespinasse are at equal removes from the conceits
and the mincing niceties of the earlier salons. ‘<span lang="fr">Il n’y
a que le premier pas qui coûte,</span>’ said Madame du
Deffand of Saint Denis walking with his severed head
in his hands; ‘<span lang="fr">Je suis une poule qui ai couvé des œufs
de canard,</span>’ said Madame Geoffrin of herself and her
daughter; ‘<span lang="fr">Presque personne n’a besoin d’être aimé,</span>’
said Mlle. de Lespinasse to her faithless lover. Is this
the language of preciosity?</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="smcap">The Eighteenth Century Salon</span></h3>

<p>A salon is not a mere literary club. It is something
other than a group of men and women gathered in a
drawing-room to discuss literature or meet a poet.
It aims to exert a creative influence in the literary
world. It does not concern itself with literature as a
finished product to be studied, but with literature as
a growing thing that may be trained. Hence it gets
behind the product to the producer, and seeks to
influence the characters and ideas out of which books
are formed. It is an informal academy. Its aim is
private in that it is directly concerned with improving
the condition of authors, and public in that it attempts
to mould public opinion.</p>

<p>Thus it is, at bottom, a system of patronage. It
offers to the author that aid, advertisement, and protection
which he had once sought from a patron.
Patronage of literature was, as we have seen, an essential
feature of the court life of the Renaissance. It had
lived on through the seventeenth century at courts
and in noble houses. During its rapid decline in the
eighteenth century, many of its duties were taken over
by the salons. In the person of the hostess, the salon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
made gifts of money, granted unofficial pensions, paid
printers’ bills, and even gave authors a home. Walpole
was amused at the number of authors who were ‘planted’
in the homes of French ladies. Madame Geoffrin
in Paris, like Mrs. Montagu in London, was recognized
as a patron of all the arts, and both gave of their
wealth to the support of indigent or improvident
authors.</p>

<p>But the salon bestowed a yet more valuable favour
in its recognition of literary merit. Like the patron,
it vouched for new authors. It gave its support to
their new ideas. And in this subtler form of patronage,
in the discharge of the duties of a literary jury or
academy, it anticipated the modern press, for it had
similar influence and fell into similar errors. Like
the modern critical review, it was at once feared and
courted by authors who affected at times to despise its
pronouncements but never ignored them. The salon
mediated between the author and the public. It
aimed, like a true critic, to correct both the conceit
of the author and the indifference of the world. It
responded to a genuine critical demand created by the
disappearance of the outworn system of patronage
and by the rapid growth of a reading democracy.
The salon sprang into renewed activity during a period
of transition. It served a peculiar need during changing
conditions, and passed away with the dawn of a
new century which had its own system of criticism by
which to dispense fame and to create opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>The growing spirit of independence in the author
had already caused grave dissatisfaction with the old
order of things, as the increasing tendency to enjoy the
society of his fellows in clubs and taverns had prepared
the author for the new order of social patronage.
D’Alembert, in his <cite>Essay on Men of Letters</cite>, speaks of
the old system in terms of strong disgust. The rôle of
courtier is the most despicable that can be acted by a
man of letters. Authors and peers should meet on a
plane of equality. ‘<span lang="fr">Les seuls grands Seigneurs dont
un homme de lettres doive désirer le commerce, sont
ceux qu’il peut traiter et regarder en toute sûreté
comme ses égaux et ses amis.</span>’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Here is a man who
will not lightly expose himself to feel the sting of charity,
for whom a new system not wanting in grace and
true appreciation must be devised. The <cite>Essay</cite> was
translated into English in 1764. The original must
have been written about the time when Johnson was
penning his immortal definition of <em>patron</em>, ‘a wretch
who supports with insolence and is paid with flattery.’</p>

<p>Was it possible for the reading world to render
assistance to men of this temper? Could a way be
found to make grants of money or to draw attention to
worthy writings without an offensive display of philanthropy?
Was it not possible to assist an author,
yet cause him to feel that any favour was conferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
by himself? The salon was the answer. It summoned
authors out of their seclusion and segregation, and
confidently bade them show the world that genius
might express itself elsewhere than in the study or the
coffee-house. Let them try an appeal to a ‘select
public.’ Let them, by the charm of their conversation
in a congenial company, break down the barriers of
indifference and prejudice. It was a call to men of
letters to treat with the world. The drawing-room in
which they were received, not as a dependent or tool,
but as chief guests doing honour to the company by
their presence, was a new field of arbitration between
authors and the world.</p>

<p>In the successful execution of any plan for the
social recognition of letters, woman must have a prominent
place. If the drawing-room is to replace the
tavern as a favourite resort of authors, the presence of
woman is as truly implied in the one as her absence is
from the other. The shift from the coffee-house to
the drawing-room was indeed a plain tribute to woman,
the new critic and the new patron. As she was already
displaying her power in the world of readers by bringing
a new tone of refinement into literature, she was
exerting the same power to draw the men of letters
into her salon.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>It was the peculiar fortune of France to produce
women to discharge this social and literary duty whose
personality is at once so brilliant and so influential
that it rises to the level of genius. These women are
not merely persons gifted with an instinct for social
leadership; they are, like Cleopatra and Elizabeth,
types of their sex and a revelation of its power. They
are the very symbols of the century, ‘the abstract and
brief chronicles of the time.’ In the amazing career
of Madame de Tencin may be read the abandoned
profligacy with which the seventeenth century closed,
and which, in sheer disillusion, turned with the new
century to decency and to letters. In Madame Geoffrin
we see the surpassing common sense of the period,
its force, its humour, its kindliness, and perhaps
something of its hardness. As the best of the bourgeois
is typified in Madame Geoffrin, the aristocracy of the
<i lang="fr">ancien régime</i> is expressed in Madame du Deffand.
Its merciless clarity, its wit, which is wisdom in masquerade,
its hardness of heart and contempt of spiritual
things, and, one is tempted to say, even its blindness,
are they not found in her? And the desolation of
her last years, with their appealing cry for love, are
they not, as Lanson has said,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the hunger of the heart
which turns at last to the gift of love and the sweetness
of tears? But it is Mlle. de Lespinasse who reveals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
romanticism in its full blow. In the history of that
movement the tornado of passions which convulsed
her spirit and at length destroyed her are no less typical
than the sorrows of Werther, or the pageant of Byron’s
bleeding heart.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It was by force of personality and by their attitude
towards life that these women succeeded in influencing
literary movements. It is not by learning or authorship
that they hold a place in the history of French literature.
Not one of them was known to her own circle
as an author or as ambitious to become one. Madame
de Tencin was, to be sure, a novelist, but she concealed
the fact from all her friends save Montesquieu and
Fontenelle, allowed her works to be attributed to others,
and kept her secret as long as she lived. Madame
du Deffand and Mlle. de Lespinasse have attained
fame as letter-writers, but through no conscious effort
on their part. Their dread of authorship is easily
explained. A successful hostess must avoid giving the
impression that she is forming a coterie in order to have
readers for her books. Madame du Bocage found her
authorship of no assistance in her career as hostess:
she was laughed at as a <i lang="fr">femme savante</i>, and her guests
were said to be invited for the purpose of praising her
poems.</p>

<p>As personality is of more consequence to the hostess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
than authorship, so maturity of experience is of more
value to her than youth and beauty. None of these
women, except Madame du Bocage (‘<span lang="la">forma Venus,
arte Minerva</span>’) pretended to the fascinations of youth.
Madame de Tencin was forty-six when her salon became
famous; Madame Geoffrin was fifty when she
succeeded Madame de Tencin as the chief hostess in
Paris, and she was sixty-seven when, as ‘queen-mother,’
she made her triumphal visit to the King of Poland.
Madame du Deffand was sixty-eight when, in the eyes
of Walpole, she eclipsed all the other hostesses in Paris;
when she was eighty, Edward Gibbon still found in her
salon, ‘the best company in Paris.’ Julie de Lespinasse,
the youngest of them all, died—and died of love—at
forty-four. It is not surprising that Walpole found
in Paris the ‘fountain of age.’<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> ‘One is never old here,’
he writes, ‘or never thought so’; and elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
‘The first step towards being in fashion is to lose an
eye or a tooth. Young people I conclude there are,
but where they exist I don’t guess: not that I complain;
it is charming to totter into vogue.’ Ten
years later he finds no change:<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> ‘It is so English to
grow old! The French are Struldbrugs improved.
After ninety they have no more caducity or distempers,
but set out on a new career.’</p>

<p>Laurence Sterne goes into greater detail. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
second period in the life of a French woman of fashion,
he says:<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> ‘When thirty-five years and more have
unpeopled her dominions of the slaves of love, she
repeoples it with the slaves of infidelity.’ Here of
course is a glance at the atheism of the <i lang="fr">philosophes</i>.
In morals, politics, and philosophy, the Parisian salon
is frankly on the radical side. It not only welcomes
new ideas, but goes in search of them. Radicalism
becomes its measure of success. The prevailing hostility
to the Church and the contempt for anything
savouring of dogma caused those who might hold
orthodox or conservative views to conceal them, lest
they be taken as evidence of a cowardly spirit or a
feeble mind. Adherents of the Church, priests, Jesuits,
the whole tribe of <i lang="fr">dévots</i>, and at last even the deists,
were condemned as pharisees and time-servers. Voltaire
himself was too cautious. ‘<span lang="fr">Il est bigot,</span>’ said a
woman to Walpole,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> ‘<span lang="fr">c’est un déiste.</span>’ When Hume
was admitted to Madame Geoffrin’s, he found no
deists there, for all had, presumably, passed on to
atheism. Madame Geoffrin herself retained an odd
sort of formal relation with the Church which amazed
her friends who whispered about it as though it were
some scandalous <i lang="fr">liaison</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the salons developed a looseness of morals and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
a so-called freedom of thought which their exponents
were fain to regard as a splendid audacity. Such
ideals are still dear to a certain class of writers chiefly
composed of minor poets. But the wits of the eighteenth
century promulgated their doctrines without the
aid of that slovenliness which is indispensable to our
free-thinking Bohemians. They adopted a manner
approved of the world in order that they might win
the world. They avoided anything that might make
themselves or their speculations ridiculous, for they
wished to <em>recommend</em> their theories to men, to challenge
their intelligence, and to capture their interest. There
is an odd simile used by Madame Necker<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> to account
for Shakespeare’s fame in England, which is of no use
whatever as explaining Shakespeare, but of great
significance because of its obvious reference to the
salons. She attributes the renown of the poet to the
acting of Garrick who, for three hours daily, <em>captures the
hearts</em> as well as the ears of the English people, and so
has the same effect that is produced in Paris by <em>conversation</em>.
The aim of the salon is, obviously, to create
interest, to capture hearts. In the same letter, when
urging Gibbon to come to Paris and enjoy the fruits
of his fame, she says, ‘<span lang="fr">C’est là seulement ... qu’on
fait passer ses sentiments dans l’âme des autres.</span>’ There
is the express aim of the salon:—to bring ideas
out of the realm of the abstract down to the business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and bosoms of men. In such a process it is the function
of the hostess to give unity and solidity to the divergent
views of her coterie, and frequently to be the channel
by which they reach the world.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Thus the salon
became a source for the dissemination of ideas and of a
new and radical philosophy.</p>

<p>But what of the influence of the salon upon the
authors who composed it? That it produced an effect
upon them the least sympathetic was obliged to acknowledge:
‘At worst,’ says Walpole,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> ‘I have filled
my mind with a new set of ideas.’ There men corrected
as well as expanded their personal views. There
they might ‘clarify their notions by filtrating them
through other minds.’<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The salon gave an opportunity
for the development of ideas in a new medium—the
liveliness of conversation. At such time, when
the formulation of opinion is stimulated by contact
with other minds, when all barriers are down, all
dread of critics forgotten, a man may give free rein
to his doctrines and borrow all the brilliancy that
lives in exaggeration.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The pomposity of the platform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and the solemn pedantry of the study disappear,
and a man talks for the joy of talking. He makes up
in vivacity what he loses in dignity. When an author
deserted the salons, as did Rousseau, it frequently
indicated a state of self-absorption which was not
always advantageous; and, on the other hand, when
an author made his submission to them, the result
was frequently evident in a note of urbanity and in a
piquancy of illustration which he could hardly have
attained elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Thus the function of the salon
was to preserve the sanity and clarity of literature, to
keep authors abreast of the times and in touch with
one another and with the world. But in this alliance
of authors with the world, in this exchange of solitude
for society, of the study for the drawing-room, there
were dangers which threatened the very life of literature;
for it was an attempt to serve two masters.
Far from removing the petty faults of a literary life, it
brought with it a host of new ones—flattery, the overestimation
of the works of a clique, the attempt to
direct public opinion by force, and above all, the
cultivation of the graces at the expense of the imagination.
There was actually a tendency towards the
dangers of democracy—the surrender to majority,
the descent to a common level—but without a saving
reliance upon the elemental instincts of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
The whole prophetic side of literature, the vision of the
poet, the glory and the folly of the ideal, priest and
lyrist, Wordsworth and Shelley, de Vigny and de
Musset—these are all beyond the ken of salons. But
they had their office. It was their function to teach
the observation of life, to lend clearness and vivacity
to style, and so to add a charm to learning, to win the
ignorant and to elevate the frivolous by showing that
dulness could be overcome with wit and pedantry
with grace.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="smcap">English Authors in Parisian Salons</span></h3>

<p>The English visitor was a familiar figure in the
Parisian salon. In an age when travellers were studying
manners rather than mountains, and preferred
the society of philosophers to the finest galleries in
Europe, no visit to Paris was complete without a conversation
with good Madame Geoffrin or an hour
with the ‘blind sibyl,’ du Deffand of the bitter tongue.
A stream of Englishmen from Prior to Gibbon poured
through their drawing-rooms<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and listened with interest
or with alarm to the <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> who were, to
use Walpole’s words,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> busily pulling down God and
the King. Sometimes a returning traveller proved
his acquaintance with this society by sacrificing his
veracity. Thus Goldsmith asserted<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> that he was
present ‘in a select company of wits of both sexes at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Paris’ when Diderot, Fontenelle, and Voltaire disputed
about the merits of English taste and learning.
The interview, it has been repeatedly shown, could
hardly have taken place, inasmuch as during the months
when Goldsmith must have been in Paris, Voltaire was
never once there. But the very lie is eloquent, for it
shows the kind of experience in Paris which English
authors sought and prized.</p>

<p>The cosmopolitan tone was contributed to the
salon by the eighteenth century. It begins with
Madame de Tencin. This brilliant woman, somewhat
promiscuous in all her tastes, expanded the influence
of her drawing-room, and thereby that of later salons,
by welcoming distinguished men without respect of
nationality; nor were foreigners slow to improve the
opportunity of meeting a woman who was no less
renowned for her social prestige than for the picturesque
iniquity of her past. Her salon was in truth the
atonement which she offered the world for the sins
of her youth.</p>

<p>She had begun her career by running away from
the convent where she had taken the veil. She used
her secularized charms to win lovers, and used her lovers
to advance her brother in the Church. She became
mistress of the Regent, who snubbed her because she
wished to talk business when his mind ran on love.
The royal harlot then sank into a cheap adventuress;
she gave birth to a son, destined to become famous as
d’Alembert, and ‘exposed’ him on the steps of Saint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Jean le Rond in the hope of making an end of him.
At length when a maddened lover shot himself to
death under her own roof, she was imprisoned in
the Bastille, where she languished for some months.
And then, after her release, as if to show that she had
a head if not a heart, she abandoned her career of
profligacy as lightly as she had formerly abandoned a
lover or a child, and opened a drawing-room which,
with the death of Madame de Lambert in 1733, became
the most brilliant and influential in Paris. Here for
twenty years she reigned over such retainers as Montesquieu
and Fontenelle. Her success is easier to
understand than her motives. Certain it is, however,
as Professor Brunel has suggested,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that she attracted
the men of letters because she gave them to understand
that their respect was the one thing in the world for
which she cared.</p>

<p>Madame de Tencin had become intimate with
Englishmen even before the days of her fame. She
was that ‘eloped nun who has supplanted the nut-brown
maid’<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> in the affections of Matthew Prior,
during his diplomatic service in Paris in the winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of 1712-13. She used him to bring the needs of her
brother (whom Prior did not consider to be ‘worth
hanging’<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>) before Lord Bolingbroke. He himself
was presently avowing her his Queen, and himself her
faithful and devoted subject ‘<i lang="fr">dans tous ses états</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Leslie Stephen<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> considers that Bolingbroke made use
of Madame de Tencin in his intrigues with the Regent;
but however this may be, his intrigues with the Regent’s
mistress became common gossip, and were published
abroad by the ballad-singer in the streets.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But Bolingbroke was not the only English peer who
paid court to the ‘<i lang="fr">nonne défroquée</i>.’ Lord Chesterfield
was introduced to her by Montesquieu, and, in
1741, passed some time in her salon, during its later
glory. Here he enjoyed the society of authors whom
he was always pleased to regard as superior to those
of his own country and whose works, particularly
Montesquieu’s <cite lang="fr">Esprit des Lois</cite>, Fontenelle’s <cite lang="fr">Pluralité
des Mondes</cite>, and the productions of Crébillon and Marivaux,
he never tired of recommending to his son.
Fontenelle, the placid death’s-head who had never
laughed and who could lead a minuet at the age of
ninety-seven, must have seemed to Chesterfield the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>pattern of a man. And yet he could assert, a few years
later, that Fontenelle had sacrificed somewhat too
much to the Graces.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>But what did he think of Madame? What did the
great exemplar of the <i lang="fr">bel air</i>, himself a patron of letters,
think of the life and aims of the salon? It is not easy
to say. He flattered Madame de Tencin outrageously,
according to his professed theories; he praised the good
taste of Frenchmen (of which Madame was at once ‘<span lang="fr">le
soutien et l’ornement</span>’), and denounced the brusqueness
of his countrymen according to his wont. He
boasted himself<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the ‘<span lang="fr">ami, favori, et enfant de la
maison</span>’ of Madame de Tencin. But when he had
occasion to describe the literary life of Paris to his
son, he declared that the salons were filled with gossips
who talked nonsense and <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> whose works
were metaphysical fustian, <i lang="la">verba et voces et praeterea
nihil</i>.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It was an institution which young Stanhope
must visit, where he was to talk epigrams, false sentiments,
and philosophical nonsense, but to which he
was to maintain a large superiority. Yet, in spite of
this show of indifference, I cannot but feel that Chesterfield
liked the salon. What else in heaven or earth was
there for such a man to like? What could have been
more to his taste than its courtly union of intrigue and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
elegance, of literature and wit, of free thought and easy
morals? The salon certainly liked Chesterfield. ‘Let
him come back to us,’ cried Montesquieu and the rest
of them when Madame de Tencin had read his letter
to the circle, and read it more than once. ‘He writes
French better than we do,’ exclaimed Fontenelle,
‘<span lang="fr">qu’il se contente, s’il lui plaît, d’être le premier homme
de sa nation, d’avoir les lumières et la profondeur de
génie qui la caractérisent; et qu’il ne vienne point
encore s’emparer de nos grâces et de nos gentillesses.</span>’<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
When Madame de Tencin despatched this mass of
flattery to Chesterfield, Fontenelle added a note begging
the English lord not to draw down upon himself
too much French jealousy.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Unless Chesterfield was,
like Fontenelle, incapable of all human emotions, he
was pleased by that. The Frenchmen had studied
him well. They touched his vulnerable point, and
posterity will not easily be persuaded that it was in
vain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘In future, then,’ said Fontenelle, after the death
of Madame de Tencin, ‘I shall go to Madame Geoffrin’s.’
The change must have supplied the aged wit
with many observations on the diversity of the female<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
character; for though ‘<span lang="fr">la Geoffrin</span>’ had studied the
methods of her predecessor, there was no resemblance
in character between the two. There is no suggestion
of Madame de Tencin’s subtlety in the amiable bourgeoise
who became a queen of society at fifty, but
rather a rich simplicity of nature that is very winning.
Her faults as well as her virtues are quite obvious.
Her humour is for ever expressing itself in homely
maxims<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> which suggest the lore of peasants. She
made her way by the simplest means, a warm heart,
abiding common sense, and a persistent will. Her
keen intelligence, the gift of nature, not of books,
enabled her to understand the philosophers at least as
well as they understood themselves, to advise—almost
lead—them, to be their ‘Mother,’ and to push them
into the Academy. It is, at first blush, amazing that
a woman without education, who, indeed, found
grammar a mystery, could thus have become the empress
of the wits. But living as she did in an ‘age of
reason’ when the imagination was turning back to
contemplate man in a ‘state of nature,’ unspoiled by
the arts of a luxurious civilization, such a defect was
not fatal. Shrewd, placid yet alert, simple and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the sweep of vision that is given only to the simple,
she looked out fearlessly upon the society of her time,
with all its elaborate systems and new philosophies—and
understood. As she was without fear, so she
was without contempt. She saw what was good in
the new order and encouraged it, but without becoming
its slave. Like Johnson (whom she would have
understood), she contrived to ‘worship in the age of
Voltaire,’ but this was with no surrender of her interest
in Voltaire. She was intolerant of pretence. She
adopted a manner of treating her friends which, in its
combination of brusqueness and affection, is thoroughly
parental. She scolds and pushes, punishes and rewards.
She decides disputes with a word. She spends
with open hand. Her great desire is to be of help to
her children. D’Alembert writes<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> of her, ‘<span lang="fr">“Vous
croyez,” disait elle à un des hommes qu’elle aimait le
plus, “que c’est pour moi que je vois des grands et des
ministres? Détrompez-vous; je les vois pour vous
et pour vos semblables, qui pouvez en avoir besoin:
si tous ceux que j’aime étaient heureux et sages, ma
porte serait tous les jours fermée a neuf heures, excepté
pour eux.”</span>’ But she never forgot that, in her
own house, she alone was mistress. Her charity, which
she conducted on a heroic scale, implied a certain
obedience in the recipients of it; but both charity and
obedience were only devices for promoting their interests.
‘<span lang="fr">Elle ne respirait que pour faire le bien,</span>’ said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
d’Alembert.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He and the other writers for the Cyclopædia
profited by her charity, for without her patronage
that great work could hardly have been carried
to publication.</p>

<p>In the salon of Madame Geoffrin and her free-thinking
friends, David Hume found, in 1763, a natural
abiding-place. It had, indeed, a dual attraction for
him in the person of its hostess and the character of
her coterie. Madame Geoffrin must have found the
Scotch philosopher a man after her own heart. She
understood the broad-featured, simple man, whom she
presently took to calling<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> her ‘coquin,’ her ‘gros
drôle.’ Like her, he enjoyed the society of rationalists.
He writes naïvely in his <cite>Autobiography</cite>: ‘Those who
have not seen the strange effects of modes, will never
imagine the strange reception I met with at Paris,
from men and women of all ranks and stations. The
more I resiled from their excessive civilities, the
more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a
real satisfaction in living at Paris from the great number
of sensible, knowing, and polite company with
which the city abounds above all places in the universe.
I thought once of settling there for life.’ But he kept
his head under the pelting flattery. He neither despised
his social success nor exalted it as the <i lang="la">summum
bonum</i>. Like Madame Geoffrin, he made no apologies
for himself, and pretended to no social graces
which he could not easily acquire. His French was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
wretched. Walpole protested<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that it was ‘almost as
unintelligible as his English.’ He had no <i lang="fr">bons mots</i>.
He did not even talk much. Grimm found<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> him
heavy, and Madame du Deffand dubbed him ‘the
peasant.’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But to more serious souls he was even as the Spirit
of the Age. He had voiced the new scepticism. He
had given the death-blow to miracles. Before his
coming to Paris, all his better-known work had been
done, and the fame of it preceded him. Alexander
Street wrote from Paris to Sir William Johnstone, on
December 16, 1762: ‘When you have occasion to see
our friend, David Hume, tell him that he is so much
worshipped here that he must be void of all passions,
if he does not immediately take post for Paris. In
most houses where I am acquainted here, one of the
first questions is, “Do you know M. Hume whom we
all admire so much?” I dined yesterday at Helvétius’s,
where this same M. Hume interrupted our conversation
very much.’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>His influence was, in truth, greater in France than
in England; for the temper of English literature never
became openly rationalistic. Deism itself was living
a subterranean existence; for the authority of such
powerful men as Johnson and Burke ran directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
counter to it. But in France all sails were set, and
men’s faces turned towards ‘unpath’d waters, undreamed
shores.’ To the ‘free’ thought that was
becoming ever freer and now drifting towards all
manner of negation, Hume came as a high priest, an
acknowledged pontiff. He was the man whom the
King delighted to honour, whose praises were lisped
by the King’s children, who was approved by Voltaire,
petted by all the women and revered by all the men.
In less than two years, Walpole finds him<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> ‘the mode,’
‘fashion itself’; he is ‘treated with perfect veneration,’
and his works held to be the ‘standards of writing.’
Hume himself writes to Fergusson<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> that he overheard
an elderly gentleman, ‘esteemed one of the cleverest
and most sensible’ of men, boasting that he had
caught sight of Hume that day at court.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> At last
they pay him the compliment (Madame Geoffrin
leading off, no doubt) of ‘bantering’ him and telling
droll stories of him. He begins to fear that the great
ladies are taking him too much from the society of
d’Alembert, Buffon, Marmontel, Diderot, and the
rest.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Among the distinguished women in Paris who wooed
him were Mlle. de Lespinasse, Madame du Bocage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
who sent him her works, and the Marquise de Boufflers,
who made no secret of her fondness for the British.
This lady once cherished a ‘<i lang="fr">petite flamme</i>’<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> for Beauclerk,
Johnson’s gay friend, and even crossed the
path of the Lexicographer himself; for it was she
whom Johnson, like a squire of dames, gallantly escorted
to her coach, and afterwards honoured with a
letter. The sentimental homage which she paid to
Hume incurred the contempt of Madame du Deffand,
who sneered at her worship of false gods, and made
her miserable by leading others to denounce her idol.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Madame de Boufflers played a prominent part in
the great quarrel between Hume and Rousseau, which
involved many of the most prominent persons mentioned
in this chapter. The story, which has been
frequently told, may be briefly dismissed.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The union
by which the sentimentalist gave himself in charge to
the rationalist, might well have furnished a Hogarth
with a subject for an allegorical group representing
Scotch solidity and Gallic perversity. Hume, through
Madame de Boufflers, had assured Rousseau that he
could find in England appreciation, friends, and a true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
home; and the ill-assorted pair accordingly departed
from Paris early in 1776. It was not long before wild
letters reached the salons.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The two philosophers were
hurling epithets at each other, <i lang="fr">scélérat! traître!</i></p>

<p>The most immediate cause of their rupture was a
letter, written by Walpole, to amuse Madame Geoffrin’s
coterie. It purported to be by the King of Prussia,
and invited Rousseau to come to court and enjoy his
fill of persecution. A brief extract will show the
character of this sprightly epistle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr">Si vous persistez à vous creuser l’esprit pour trouver
de nouveaux malheurs, choisissez-les tels que vous
voudrez. Je suis roi, je puis vous en procurer augré
de vos souhaits: et ce qui sûrement ne vous arrivera
pas vis-à-vis de vos ennemis, je cesserai de vous persécuter
quand vous cesserez de mettre votre gloire à
l’être.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This letter, which had been touched up by Helvétius
and the Duc de Nivernois, circulated in the salons,
and at last found its way to England, where it was
printed by various newspapers in April 1766. The
quarrel between Rousseau and Hume, which had been
threatening for some weeks, now burst in fury; for
Rousseau believed that Hume was in league with
Walpole to disgrace him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>Every one now plunged into controversy and correspondence.
Mlle. de Lespinasse attempts to soothe feelings.
D’Alembert outlines Hume’s campaign. Baron
d’Holbach condoles. Walpole explains. Madame de
Boufflers fears for the renown of philosophy. Madame
du Deffand, who hated everybody concerned, except
Walpole, and whom d’Alembert accused of having
stirred up all the trouble, finally did as much as any
one to put an end to it.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Nothing having been accomplished,
and the vanity of all having been fully
displayed, the matter subsided, leaving a general conviction
in the mind of each that all the others had conducted
themselves very foolishly.</p>

<p>Hume never returned to the salons, though Mlle.
de Lespinasse implored and Madame de Boufflers
protested. It was to the latter that he wrote the tranquil
letter from his death-bed ‘without any anxiety
or regret’<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> which elicited the admiration even of
Madame du Deffand<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and delighted the salons by
showing that their favourite could die like a philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Hume’s acceptance of the salon and its ideals is in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
striking contrast to the fussy dissatisfaction of Horace
Walpole. ‘I was expressing my aversion,’ he writes,
‘to disputes: Mr. Hume, who very gratefully admires
the tone of Paris, having never known any other tone,
said with great surprise, “Why, what do you like if
you hate both disputes and whisk?”’ Walpole’s
reply is not recorded. Certainly he did not like <i lang="fr">les
philosophes</i> and their conversation which he found
‘solemn, pedantic, and seldom animated but by a
dispute.’<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He hated authors by profession. He hated
political talk (having practical knowledge and experience
of politics). He hated <i lang="fr">savants</i>, free thinkers, and
<i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>, with their eternal dissertations on religion
and government.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> ‘I have never yet,’ he wrote<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> to
Montagu, ‘seen or heard anything serious that was
not ridiculous. Jesuits, Methodists, philosophers, politicians,
the hypocrite Rousseau, the scoffer Voltaire, the
encyclopedistes, the Humes, the Lytteltons, the Grenvilles,
the atheist tyrant of Russia, and the mountebank
of history Mr. Pitt, all are to me but impostors
in their various ways.’ He is ‘sick of visions and systems
that shove one another aside and come over again
like the figures in a moving picture.’ Yet like all
scoffers, he has nothing to set up in the place of all
this. He could not give his heart to the new system,
but he was equally incapable of being loyal to the old.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Dissatisfied with both, he laughed at both, and was
nettled because he could find none in Paris to laugh
with him. Laughing was not fashionable in the salons.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
He despised the prevalent devotion to cards. He was
scornfully amused at the popularity of the English
in Paris—and even at his own popularity. ‘<span lang="fr">Vous
n’observez,</span>’ said Madame du Deffand, ‘<span lang="fr">que pour
vous moquer; vous ne tenez à rien, vous vous passez
de tout; enfin, enfin, rien ne vous est nécessaire.</span>’<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
But there was one thing necessary to Walpole, and it
was the thing he professed to despise—the salon.
Without knowing the salons he could not ridicule them.
No satirist can be a hermit. So Walpole frequented
the salons, and vastly enjoyed, not the salons themselves,
but his own superiority to them. It was at
Madame Geoffrin’s that his career began. He brought
a note of introduction from Lady Hervey, met Madame
Geoffrin, and discovered to his surprise—and the
reader’s—that he liked her. She had sense, ‘more
common sense than he almost ever met with.’<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He
notes her quickness in penetrating character, her
protection of artists, her services to them, and her
‘thousand little arts and offices of friendship,’ of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
latter she was presently to give him a specimen. When
he had an attack of gout, she took him under her care.
On October 13, 1765, he writes of her to Lady Hervey:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Madame Geoffrin came and sat two hours last night
by my bedside:<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> I could have sworn it had been my
lady Hervey, she was so good to me. It was with so
much sense, information, instruction, and correction!
The manner of the latter charms me. I never saw
anybody in my days that catches one’s faults and
vanities and impositions so quick, that explains them
to one so clearly, and convinces one so easily. I never
liked to be set right before! You cannot imagine
how I taste it! I make her both my confessor and
director, and begin to think I shall be a reasonable
creature at last, which I had never intended to be.
The next time I see her, I believe I shall say, ‘Oh!
Common Sense,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> sit down: I have been thinking so
and so; is it not absurd?’—for t’other sense and
wisdom, I never liked them; I shall now hate them
for her sake. If it was worth her while, I assure your
Ladyship she might govern me like a child.</p>
</div>

<p>The attention which he received was not without
its effect, and at last he was obliged to admit himself
pleased.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> He does not know when he will return to
England; and he dwells with delight on the honours
and distinctions he receives.</p>

<p>He became one of the most prominent men in Parisian
society, and for a time eclipsed the reputation of Hume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
himself. The latter had been worshipped as a philosopher;
Walpole reigned as a wit. The letter to
Rousseau, which has been described above, captivated
the salons, and probably even made them laugh.
The <i lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>, which had first occurred to him at
Madame Geoffrin’s, so pleased him that he cast it into
more elaborate form, displayed the forged letter in the
salons, and became famous at once. ‘The copies,’
he writes to Conway, ‘have spread like wildfire; <i lang="fr">et
me voici à la mode</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It was long before Walpole
heard the last of his jest; for, as we have seen, it
involved him in the controversy between Hume and
Rousseau, and Walpole hated controversy as much as
he loved wit. But for the moment it served to draw
the eyes of the French world upon him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had become intimate with Madame
Geoffrin’s great rival, the blind Madame du Deffand,
now in her sixty-ninth year, who rapidly displaced
Madame Geoffrin in his affections. By December
1765, he was supping with her twice a week, and in
January he wrote Gray his famous description of her:<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Madame du Deffand was for a short time mistress
of the Regent, is now very old and stone-blind, but
retains all her vivacity, wit, memory, judgement,
passions, and agreeableness. She goes to operas, plays,
suppers, and Versailles; gives suppers twice a week;
has everything new read to her; makes new songs and
epigrams, ay, admirably, and remembers every one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
that has been made these fourscore years. She corresponds
with Voltaire, dictates charming letters to him,
contradicts him, is no bigot to him or anybody, and
laughs both at the clergy and the philosophers. In a
dispute, into which she easily falls, she is very warm,
and yet scarce ever in the wrong: her judgement on
every subject is as just as possible; on every point of
conduct as wrong as possible: for she is all love and
hatred, passionate for her friends to enthusiasm, still
anxious to be loved, I don’t mean by lovers, and a
vehement enemy, but openly. As she can have no
amusement but conversation, the least solitude and
<i lang="fr">ennui</i> are insupportable to her, and put her into the
power of several worthless people, who eat her suppers
when they can eat nobody’s of higher rank; wink to one
another, and laugh at her; hate her because she has
forty times more parts—and venture to hate her because
she is not rich.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was natural that Walpole should prefer her society
to Madame Geoffrin’s. Being Horace Walpole, it
was inevitable that he should come to regard Madame
Geoffrin’s coterie with disdain, to complain that it
was made up of ‘pretended <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>’ and <i lang="fr">faux
savants</i>, and that they were ‘very impertinent and
dogmatic.’<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Madame herself had offended him by
calling him<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> ‘the new Richelieu’ in reference to his
numerous conquests. Walpole grew suddenly afraid of
the Geoffrin’s intimacy, and feared that he was becoming
an object of ridicule. But in Madame du Deffand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
he found one of his own sort, a woman used to the
society of the great but with no illusions about it,
a woman who ruled her circle by despising almost
every one who came into it, who had no faith in any
one, and least of all in the authors and diplomats who
surrounded her, and whose society she endured only because
she found it less intolerable than her dark solitude.</p>

<p>In a beautiful letter to her on her blindness, which
had become total about a dozen years before the
period when we encounter her, Montesquieu reminded<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
her that they were both ‘small rebel spirits condemned
to darkness.’ There is in truth something suggestive
of the powers of darkness in Madame du Deffand’s
pride and perversity. She was of a will never to submit
or yield. Pride in the reputation she had made,
a passionate delight in conversation, and, above all,
the horror of her lonely hours of introspection determined
her to continue her salon in spite of all. She
did not fail. But a blow hardly less grievous had
yet to fall. Mlle. de Lespinasse, on whose assistance
she had leaned, had caught the secret of her success,
and was forming a coterie of her own, an inner circle
within Madame du Deffand’s. When the blind woman
learned of her assistant’s treachery, she broke with
her, and Mlle. de Lespinasse departed, carrying with
her d’Alembert, adored of Madame du Deffand, and
his friends, the flower of the flock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Even then the dauntless old woman would not give
up. The aged sibyl in her ‘tonneau’<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> at the Convent
Saint Joseph could still attract the curious and the
clever. Blind as she was, her ‘portraits’ of character
were better than Madame Geoffrin’s,—who excelled
in portraits,—and the clarity of her vision was surpassed
only by the crispness of her phrasing. At
sixty-eight, she had an eager curiosity about her own
times<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> that was a stimulus to youth. To speak with
her was to witness the triumph of mind.</p>

<p>But her heart was as dust and ashes within her.
About her she could feel only duplicity and hatred;<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
she had no faith in man or in God. She considered
her friends as those who would not kill but would
look on while others killed.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The springs of happiness
and hope had gone dry. And always the spectre of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Ennui steals behind her, and casts its shadow over her
withered soul. Literature no longer interests or
amuses; she finds philosophy poisoned by affectation;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
she is bored by all historians, and is glad when she
can lay down the first volume of Gibbon.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> She hears
Gluck’s <cite lang="fr">Orphée</cite>, and is bored. She hears <cite>The Barber
of Seville</cite>, and is bored.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> She reads the <cite>Iliad</cite>, and is
bored.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> There is nothing in her life that does not feel
this blight.</p>

<p>And then, in the late evening of her days, a miracle
occurred. The dry branch budded and bloomed.
In the person of Walpole, with his chill though delicate
cynicism (so like her own), romance burst into her life,
and she knew love and the pain of love. Her passion
for the Englishman twenty years her junior transcends
all comparison. It has in it the tenderness of age without
its resignation, and the insistence of youth without
its joy. It wreaks itself in protestations, reproaches,
and demands which it knows must be futile. In
Madame du Deffand’s letters to Walpole, recently
published in their entirety,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> there is a strong undercurrent
which moves relentlessly to tragedy—tragedy
that is no less poignant because its protagonist is an
old woman and its theme the progress of a slow despair.</p>

<p>To Walpole all this was a source of great uneasiness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Like most superior folk, he feared the world. He
feared that letters might be intercepted, that Madame
du Deffand might talk; that the story might become
public; that he might become an object of ridicule—and
ridicule was to him a hell. He urged upon Madame
du Deffand the necessity of reticence. He was crushingly
persistent. The aged woman did her best to
smother her feelings, but she could not altogether
smother her resentment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr">J’ai une véritable amitié pour vous, vous le savez,
et quoique vous vous en soyez souvent trouvé importuné,
que vous ayez fait tout votre possible et
même tout ce qui est <em>inimaginable</em> pour détruire cette
amitié, je suis persuadée que vous n’êtes point fâché
qu’elle subsiste.... Et comment est-il possible qu’un
aussi bon homme que vous veuille tourmenter une si
faible créature que moi, de qui vous ne pouvez jamais
craindre aucun mal, ni qui puisse vous faire encourir
aucun ridicule ni aucun blâme?<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Walpole’s letters to Madame du Deffand are fortunately
not preserved; but one imagines that he was
bored by this strain. To him Madame du Deffand
was an aristocratic French woman, a match for him in
wit, frankness, and cynicism, who could provide him
with that social life which, like her, he affected to
despise but could not abandon. He had admired her
capacity for disillusion, and now she was the victim
of an illusion, and he was the object of it. The situation
was unusual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>But though Walpole could not respond, he did not
break with her, or care to break. When, in 1775, he
visited her, for the third time, she showered him with
so many engagements that he needed ‘the activity of
a squirrel and the strength of a Hercules’ to go through
with them.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> He was pleased. He asserted that
Madame du Deffand was a star in the East well worth
coming to adore.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> With a literary friendship that displayed
itself in salons, in dedications of books, and in
temperate letters, he could be well content. At her
death he wrote of her with true affection, gratitude,
and grief. But she had longed in vain for the expression
of these, and of more than these, during the desolation
of her latter months.</p>

<p>The effect upon Walpole of this acquaintance with
Madame du Deffand and her salon was to fix in him
certain characteristics not always attractive. She
had been able to show him the salon in the one aspect
which could appeal to him; where persiflage had not
yielded to the pedantry of the new philosophy. In
his association with her and with the group whose
inspiration she was, he acquired that amused tolerance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
with which he viewed the attempts of the bluestockings
in England to rival the salons which he had known
in France.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Among Madame du Deffand’s visitors was the man
to whom she referred as ‘the famous Mr. Burke.’
His visit to Paris was of less than a month’s duration.
Madame du Deffand met him on February 9, 1773;<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
and he left France, apparently on the first day of
March.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Burke had not come to Paris to enjoy the
fruits of his fame—though his reputation in the salons
as the author of the Junius letters<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> would have given
him a career—or to study the philosophical and political
principles of the day. He had placed his son
Richard at Auxerre to learn French; but before returning
to England he glanced at the French court
and at the salons. His attitude towards the latter
was unique. ‘It was,’ says Morley,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> ‘almost as though
the solemn hierophant of some mystic Egyptian temple
should have found himself amid the brilliant chatter of
a band of reckless, keen-tongued disputants of the
garden or the porch at Athens.’ Yet any seriousness
of manner which he may have displayed exalted him in
the eyes of the philosophers. Madame du Deffand,
though she afterwards learned to despise his writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
as verbose, diffuse, obscure, and affected,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> liked him
at once. ‘<span lang="fr">Il me paraît avoir infiniment d’esprit,</span>’
she writes,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and again, ‘<span lang="fr">Il est très aimable.</span>’ She gave
a supper for him, and exerted herself to assemble the
most distinguished and clever members of her circle.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
She had him invited to Madame de Luxembourg’s,
where he heard La Harpe read a new tragedy in verse,
<cite lang="fr">Les Barmécides</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> He also talked with Madame du
Deffand of a new book, <cite lang="fr">Essai Générale de Tactique</cite><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
by the Count de Guibert, dealing with the state of
politics and military science in Europe. This elaborate
and enthusiastic treatise, which contained an
attack on idle sovereigns and corrupt courts, appealed
to Burke; and, at Madame du Deffand’s request, he
carried a copy of it to Walpole. Burke knew the
same author’s tragedy, <cite lang="fr">Le Connétable de Bourbon</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
a fact worth mention as indicating an acquaintance
with the salon of Mlle. de Lespinasse, whose lover the
author was. Burke must have heard Guibert read this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
play aloud, for it had not yet been acted or published,
and the reading may well have occurred at Mlle. de
Lespinasse’s. Again, it may have been in that salon
that Burke attacked the philosophy of Hume,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and
defended Beattie against the sneers of the free thinkers—a
course that must have taxed his abundant ingenuity
as much as his defective French.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know the conversation
that passed between Burke and Walpole after the
former’s return to England. They met, and it would
seem that Burke expressed strong opinions on the
growing atheism of France, and told of his attempt to
defend the Christian system, for Walpole wrote<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
to the Countess of Upper Ossory: ‘Mr. Burke is
returned from Paris, where he was so much the mode
that, happening to dispute with the philosophers,
it grew the fashion to be Christians. St. Patrick himself
did not make more converts.’ But whatever effect
Burke may have had upon the freethinkers of Paris,
there can be no doubt of their effect upon him. The
amazing downrush of principles, religious, philosophical,
and political, which he witnessed in France confirmed
him in that natural conservatism, that desire
‘never wholly or at once to depart from antiquity’
to which he was becoming more and more passionately
devoted as the great French crisis drew on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The spectacle of Burke converting the philosophers
to Christianity sinks into pale insignificance beside
Yorick Sterne’s conversion of Madame de Vence from
the perils of deism—an incident familiar to every
reader of <cite>The Sentimental Journey</cite>. It was in the
winter of 1762 that Sterne made his entry into the
salons, and discovered those guiding principles of
compliment, flattery, and general philandering, which
enabled him to win all the <i lang="fr">esprits</i>, and, incidentally, to
put an end to the deism of Madame de Vence. Seated
on a sofa beside the lady, whose waning beauty should
have made her a deist five years before, he revealed
the dangers to which beauty, particularly in deists,
was exposed, and dwelt on the defense provided by
religious sentiments. ‘“We are not adamant,” said
I, taking hold of her hand—“and there is need of all
restraints, till age in her own time steals in and lays
them on us—but, my dear lady,” said I, kissing her
hand—“’tis too—too soon——” I declare I had
the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de
V——. She affirmed to Mons. D——<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and the
Abbe M——<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> that in one half-hour I had said more
for revealed religion than all their Encyclopedia had
said against it—I was lifted directly into Madame
de V——’s <cite lang="fr">Coterie</cite>—and she put off the epocha of
deism for two years.’</p>

<p>Yorick learned, too, the importance of self-obliteration.
‘I had been misrepresented to Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Q—— as an <i lang="fr">esprit</i>—Madame de Q—— was an
<i lang="fr">esprit</i> herself: she burnt with impatience to see me,
and hear me talk. I had not taken my seat before I
saw she did not care a sous whether I had any wit
or no—I was let in, to be convinced she had.—I
call heaven to witness I never once opened the door
of my lips.’</p>

<p>Such anecdotes may not give us facts,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> but they
record something quite as useful, Sterne’s impression
of the salon, and are a reliable indication of his general
conduct there. The wits of Paris found the most
perfect resemblance between Sterne and his books.
Garat asserts<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that between seeing the author and
reading his works there was almost no difference at all.
There are peculiarly Shandian touches in some of his
letters to Garrick, as his mention<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> of the Baron
d’Holbach, ‘one of the most learned men over here, the
great protector of wits and the Sçavans who are no
wits.’ Baron d’Holbach was the ‘maître d’hôtel’ of
philosophy, friend of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot,
with a salon of his own, in which he presided over a
school of physicists who held a new theory of nature.
Four years later Walpole<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> eschewed this ‘pigeon-house’
of <i lang="fr">savants</i> and their system of antediluvian
deluges invented to prove the eternity of matter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Sterne, who was more affable than Walpole, though no
less sharp-sighted, enjoyed himself there and became
a friend of Diderot (to whom he presented a collection
of English books).</p>

<p>It is probable that Sterne made a pretty complete
tour of the salons, and there is good reason for assuming
that at Madame Geoffrin’s<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> he made the acquaintance
of Mlle. de Lespinasse. This young woman,
who was about to become one of the most brilliant
hostesses in Paris,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> was eagerly appreciative of the
emotional aspect of Sterne’s work. Compact of passion
and nerves, a disciple of Rousseau, a ‘daughter of the
Sun,’<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and a sort of female counterpart of Byron, she
ate her heart out, was consumed with hopeless love
for three men at once, and attempted suicide, quite
in the familiar manner of a later school. To love and
pain, to heaven and hell, she determined to devote
herself.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Loathing the world where ‘fools and automatons
abound,’ she must construct the world of
romance for herself.</p>

<p>Shandyism won her by its frank display of emotion.
There were aspects of it which she could never have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
appreciated, its wayward humour and insincerity, its
sprightliness and its dirt; but the tears and the tenderness
she understood by instinct. The loves of
Yorick and Eliza, never very popular in England,
appealed to her as after the order of nature, and no
doubt reminded her of her own relations with
d’Alembert.</p>

<p>After the appearance of the <cite>Sentimental Journey</cite>,
Mlle. de Lespinasse wrote two chapters<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> in imitation
of that work which, though reproducing only such
features of Sterne’s manner as she understood, are of
great importance as showing the influence of Sterne
in the salons. In these the French sentimentalist
has adopted the Englishman’s manner in order to pay
court to her benefactor, Madame Geoffrin. The
chapters record two examples<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of the elder woman’s
charity. The first of these, the incident of the broken
vase, is attributed to Sterne himself. Yorick is represented
as discovering that a vase which he has recently
purchased has a broken lid. The workmen who
have just delivered the treasure implore him to have
mercy upon their fellow who broke it, whose accident
has so alarmed him that he has not dared to appear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
He is now fairly in the road to ruin. Pleased with the
sympathetic distress of the brother artisans, Yorick
inquires into the case, and is able, through La Fleur,
to relieve the poor fellow’s misery. He ministers to the
needs of a wife and four children, and rewards the
kindly friends with a generous <i lang="fr">pourboire</i>.</p>

<p>The scene of the second chapter is Madame Geoffrin’s
salon. Here Sterne is represented as hearing that
lady tell the story of her milk-woman. The pathetic
death of a cow (sole prop of the milk-woman’s family)
recalls the incidents of the dead ass, and of Maria de
Moulines and her goat in the <cite>Sentimental Journey</cite>; but
there are serious deficiencies. Sterne, like Mlle. de
Lespinasse, would have dwelt on the sentimental
pleasure of presenting the milk-woman with two consolatory
cows, but he would not have missed the
humour in the fact that the cream afterwards delivered
to Madame Geoffrin was not fit to drink. Mlle. de
Lespinasse shows her appreciation of Sterne’s sentimentalism
and her ignorance of his Shandyism.</p>

<p>This imitation of Sterne seems to be the chief record
in French of Yorick’s impression on the salon. If
it is a reliable view—and there seems to be no good
reason for rejecting it—it is clear that Sterne preferred
to appear in the drawing-room of Paris without
his cap and bells. He realized perhaps that the way
to win the hearts of French ladies was with his warm
heart and his tearful eye, and not by the sudden
caprice of his humour. It was Sterne the emotional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
epicure, the professed philanderer, and not Yorick the
jester, who was known to the salons; and in thus
exploiting his sentimentalism, he continued and emphasized
one aspect of the work of Rousseau, and,
with Richardson, became one of the chief foreign influences
exerted upon the romantic movement in
France.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But it was not till the time of Gibbon that any English
author duplicated the success of Hume in the
Parisian salon, for none had so nearly satisfied the
conditions required of an <i lang="fr">esprit fort</i>. Gibbon was the
destroyer of ancient superstitions, who had attacked
ecclesiastical tyranny with a new weapon. The
scepticism out of which Hume had made a philosophy
became in Gibbon’s <cite>Decline and Fall</cite> a new historical
method as deadly as it was disguised. For Gibbon,
as for Hume, the salon was a sort of Valhalla, at once
a reward and an arena, in which, surrounded by his
peers, he was to continue his slaughterous career.
Success came at once. He was more popular than
Hume, for he did not have the social defects which
had, after a time, somewhat dimmed the lustre of
Hume’s success. He had, for example, no difficulty
with the French language, a tongue which he had
spoken from his youth.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Madame du Deffand found
him as French as her closest friends,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and Madame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Necker rebuked him for allowing a Frenchman to
translate his <cite>History</cite> when he could have done it
better himself.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Moreover, though he was an uglier
duckling than Hume, his manners had a pomposity
which did not encourage familiarity. ‘<span lang="fr">Il ne tombe pas
dans les mêmes ridicules,</span>’ said Madame du Deffand,
who regarded it as no slight achievement to avoid
becoming a fool when surrounded by fools.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Something of Gibbon’s success was due to a period
of preparation, as it were, an earlier career in the
salons fourteen years before. He had received his
training in 1763 when, at the age of twenty-six, he had
come to Paris to meet the literary world, to membership
in which he felt himself entitled by his <cite lang="fr">Essai sur
l’Étude de la Littérature</cite>, a work which had achieved
the dignity of a second edition. Lady Hervey had furnished
him with an introduction to Madame Geoffrin,
and he found a place weekly at her famous Wednesday
dinners. He visited other salons, notably those
of Madame du Bocage and of the Baron d’Holbach,
who had entertained Sterne the year before. Helvétius
treated him like a friend.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It was a sufficient
success for a young man. It was not to be expected
that he should leave an impress upon Parisian society
at this time, nor did he; but there is little doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
that society contributed in some measure to his lucidity
of vision and to the prevailing spirit of disillusion
for which he was presently to be famous.</p>

<p>When he returned to Paris in 1777 he shone in no
reflected light, for the publication of the first volume
of his <cite>Decline and Fall</cite> in the preceding year had already
made him a European reputation. The book
was almost immediately translated into French. The
spirit of the work, and in particular the famous explanation
of the development of Christianity, appealed to
the philosophers. The indignant but somewhat ineffectual
attacks of pious English folk upon the rationalistic
historian pleased them hardly less. Gibbon’s
reception was all that he could desire. ‘I was introduced,’
he tells us in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, ‘to the first names
and characters of France, who distinguished me by
such marks of civility and kindness as gratitude will
not suffer me to forget and modesty will not allow me
to enumerate.’ According to his own account,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> he
shone in disputes, and got his great victory over the
Abbé Mably in the discussion concerning the republican
form of government. But in general, the French were
struck by his affability. Madame du Deffand could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
find no other fault in him than his abiding desire to
please, and observed that <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> had the same
fascination for him that the weapons of Odysseus had
for the disguised Achilles. At times he seemed servile,
and she was on the point of telling him to comfort
himself with the reflection that he deserved to be a
Frenchman.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>But though he was much in the company of Madame
du Deffand, that ‘agreeable young lady of eighty-two,’<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
to whom Walpole had given him a letter of
introduction; though he found the best company in
Paris in her salon, and made numerous visits with
her (notably to the Marquise de Boufflers’); though
he constantly took supper with her<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> when she happened
to be supping at home, it was not with her that he
was most intimate during his triumphant months in
Paris. His name will ever be linked with that of
Madame Necker. His relations with her had begun
nearly a quarter of a century before, and may be read,
in a somewhat ameliorated version, in his own <cite>Memoirs</cite>;
the lady’s story is more fully set forth by the Vicomte
d’Haussonville in <cite lang="fr">Le Salon de Madame Necker</cite>. It
will suffice to say here that, after being jilted by Gibbon,
the ambitious young Suisse had married a man destined
to be hardly less famous in his own time, had
moved to Paris, studied, as it were, under Madame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Geoffrin, and at length opened a salon of her own.
Though less brilliantly gifted than other hostesses,
she was perhaps even more ambitious than they.
There is something modern about her passion for
improvement. She was not unwilling to be a <i lang="fr">femme
savante</i>. She disputed with the philosophers and
recorded philosophical platitudes, along with gossip
and rules of grammar, in her commonplace-book.
It may have been the literary ambition of this lady,
it may have been her essential sweetness of character,
it may have been some form of feminine pride, that
led her to seek friendship with the man who had once
refused her his love. During her visit to London in
1776, Hume was constant in his attentions to her and
to her husband. In September, after her return to
France, she wrote to him,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> urging him to come to her:
‘<span lang="fr">C’est à Paris qu’il est agréable d’être un grand homme.</span>’
When at length he came, she would no doubt have
been glad to ‘plant’ him in her house, after the French
custom; but Gibbon preferred his freedom: ‘The
reception I have met with from them,’ he writes,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
‘very far surpassed my most sanguine expectations.
I do not indeed lodge in their house (as it might excite
the jealousy of the husband, and procure me a letter
de cachet), but I live very much with them, dine and
sup whenever they have company, which is almost
every day, and whenever I like it, for they are not in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the least exigeans.’ Their satisfaction was no less
than Gibbon’s. His serious conversation delighted
the serious soul of Madame Necker<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> by its union of
interest in details with enthusiasm for great principles,
and by the sundry graces which adorned it.</p>

<p>Madame du Deffand always felt that Gibbon’s
respect for the standards of the <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> had corrupted
his style. She heard in it the declamatory tone
of the salons; it had the glitter and the lust for fame
with which she was well acquainted.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> She knew of
course that this could not have been the result of
Gibbon’s later sojourn in Paris, but she was aware that
he had come under the influence of the French salons
during an earlier visit. Her hypothesis, which accounts
for something of the inflated rhetoric of Gibbon,
is certainly worthy of attention; and it may be noted,
in support of her view, that Madame Necker, who is
a fair measure of what the <i lang="fr">philosophes</i> wanted, found
in Gibbon’s style a ‘captivating magic.’<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>When Gibbon left Paris there was universal regret.
At the Neckers’ they talked of nothing but this bereavement<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
and the hope of a return. He went back,
in pudgy complacency, to his historical studies. He
had conversed and even disputed with the prophets
of a new era; but like the other rationalists, he seems
to have had no suspicion of the great change which
was presently to make salons impossible. His ignorance
of the approaching storm is a significant illustration
of the fact that the discussions of the salon were
essentially academic, conducted in happy ignorance
of the results which were destined to succeed them.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="smcap">The Earlier English Salon</span></h3>

<p>The first English salons, broadly so termed, appear
in the age of Elizabeth. A tradition of the social
patronage of letters was then established which had a
short though brilliant history and which might, under
favourable conditions, have become of permanent
importance to the literature. It could not, however,
survive the period of the Civil Wars and the Commonwealth;
and thus the earlier English salon, despite its
promising beginning, goes from less to less until it
disappears altogether about 1700. The later salon
had no connection with it; indeed the eighteenth
century seems to have been quite unaware of its
existence. The earlier institution was perhaps more
national in character; it was certainly more vital, and
it will therefore be profitable to sketch its history, if
only for purposes of contrast. This earlier movement
must be carefully distinguished from the larger subject
of woman’s place in English literature, from her contribution
to and her growing interest in it; above all,
it must be distinguished from the history of English
<i lang="fr">femmes savantes</i>. Such a larger subject there is, but
I have no intention of treating it here. My purpose
is merely to point out those social and literary institutions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
set up by English women which correspond in a
general way with the salons as described in the second
and third chapters of this work.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan prototype of the salon is even
closer to the Renaissance courts than the French salons
themselves. The greatest of the Elizabethan patronesses,
the Countess of Pembroke, was, even in her own
day, compared with Elizabeth Gonzaga,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and her house
at Wilton, which contemporaries refer to as a ‘college’
or ‘school,’ was like nothing so much as the little
academe that we have seen to be characteristic of
Italy. Although the most distinguished female writer
of her age, the Countess of Pembroke was, and is,
better known for her coterie than for her writings.
‘She was,’ says Aubrey, ‘the greatest patronesse of
wit and learning of any lady of her time.’<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Spenser
hailed her (in true salon style) as Urania, and Meres
compared her to Octavia, Virgil’s patroness. Like
her brother, she was enthusiastic for the classical
tradition, and used her influence with Kyd and Daniel
to keep Senecan tragedy alive. The dedication to
Daniel’s <cite>Defence of Ryme</cite> implies that the book was
produced under her immediate inspiration. The
author refers to Wilton as his ‘best schoole,’ in the
same tone in which Spenser acknowledges himself
‘bounden’ to it ‘by many singular favours and great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
graces.’ Miss Young, the recent biographer of the
Countess, who proclaims her ‘in the very best sense
of the word a bluestocking,’ marshals a list of twenty
works dedicated to her, and the list might be almost
indefinitely extended by adding to it the passages in
Elizabethan poetry written in her praise. To neglect
the latter would be to pass over some of the most
typical utterances of Edmund Spenser.</p>

<p>Thus Elizabethan England saw the salon at its
finest. With the ideal of courtly society numerous
translations of the Italian classics had already made
it familiar. There is evidence of the ideal everywhere
in Shakespeare’s romantic comedies. The preciosity
of the court of Navarre and the whole tone of <cite>Love’s
Labour’s Lost</cite>, the badinage of Benedick and Beatrice,
the poetic dialogue of Lorenzo and Jessica in praise
of the night, and even the mingling of the courtly and
the pastoral in the life of Arden Forest—these are all
near to the spirit of the Renaissance court and the
society with which we are dealing. The company of
gallant men and gracious women idealized in Shakespeare’s
comedies might well have served as the model
of the salon, had the seventeenth century fostered
the development of anything so courtly.</p>

<p>Hardly less distinguished is the group of men who
surrounded Lucy, Countess of Bedford. Her house at
Twickenham Park, famous for its Holbeins and its
garden, she loved to fill with men of genius. Ben
Jonson, Chapman, Davies, Drayton, and Daniel were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
all proud to call themselves her friend, and almost
every one of them dedicated to her some work of
permanent value in English literature. Jonson addressed
to her a poetical epistle and three characteristic
epigrams. His language, though pompous, is
probably sincere:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">The Countess was the recipient of more great verse
than the entire group of bluestockings. Daniel, who
celebrated her in the <cite>Vision of the Twelve Goddesses</cite>,
has been called her poet laureate, and there would be
no reason for rejecting the title if it did not more
properly belong to John Donne. Not only did that
poet write <cite>Twicknam Garden</cite> in her honour, and address
her repeatedly in verse epistles which praise her
beauty, virtue, and learning in terms of the most
affectionate extravagance, but, says Mr. Gosse, owed
to her the very revival of interest in his art.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Donne’s
letters seem to show that he submitted poems to the
judgment of the Countess; for she was herself a poet,
and is thought to have written one of the elegies commonly
attributed to Donne.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Certain it is that at her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
house he enjoyed the very type of society which, a
century later, made the fame of salons. He always
speaks of Lady Bedford with the same gratitude and
awe which may be found in Castiglione’s praise of
the Duchess of Urbino; he accepted the same sort of
pecuniary assistance from her that Frenchmen received
from Madame Geoffrin. Nay, more, he goes to her
in her garden that he may, at eye and ear,</p>

<p class="noindent">He writes to Sir Henry Goodyer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For her delight (since she descends to them) I had

<p class="noindent">He is concerned not to be lightly esteemed ‘in that
Tribe and that house’ where he has lived.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>In all respects, therefore, the Countess’s coterie
would seem to stand just half-way between court and
salon—if it is necessary to distinguish the two terms
at all. If it is urged that we have no evidence of the
stimulus wrought by conversation in the group, it may
be answered that even this lack is apparent only and
is due simply to the meagreness of contemporary records.</p>

<p>Similarly slender is our knowledge of other women
whom we ought in all probability to associate with the
two just discussed: Lady Rutland, Lady Wroth, and
the Countess of Huntington, women who felt a keen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
interest in poets and in the welfare of poetry. As it
is, the death of Lady Bedford in 1627 must be taken
as marking the end of the Elizabethan system of
feminine patronage.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the accession of Charles I and the supremacy
of French social ideals in the person of Queen Henrietta
Maria, a change comes over the salon. A new side of
it is developed, and an older side is forgotten. What
had been a court of patronage became a court of love.
The system of Platonic love, which is a characteristic
mark of salons at various periods, comes to the fore.
It had existed in the earlier salons, as Donne’s Petrarchan
devotion to the Countess of Bedford is sufficient
to show; but the new order of things made it the centre
of all. This shift of emphasis was a loss to the salon,
for literature—or rather poetry—became a tool in
the process of courtship rather than an end in itself;
and the mistress accepted poetical conceits and extravagant
lyrics as evidence of worship from her
‘servants’ in love. Thus the whole system of courtly
love was introduced hot from France, and the subtleties
and silliness of the <i lang="fr">précieuses galantes</i> were seen in
England.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The type of the new salon mistress is the
Countess Carlisle, a Percy by birth, the favourite of
Henrietta Maria, and the idol of the court. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
received poetical tributes of the conventional kind
from half the poets of the era, and the story of her
gallantries—to give them no harsher name—is a
part of the history of England.</p>

<p>Intrigue is the natural result of gallantry such as
this, and intrigue lasted long after the original Platonic
impetus was spent. Intrigue naturally tends away
from social life: Platonic emotions make excellent
subjects for discussion, but intrigue is impatient of
talk. Any one who will compare Cartwright’s <cite>Panegyric
to the Countess of Carlisle</cite> with Suckling’s <cite>Lady
Carlisle Walking in Hampton Court Garden</cite> may see how
readily Platonic ecstasies sank into the filth of the mire.
The two poems measure the extremes of courtly verse,
and define its nature. It ranges, as Mr. Fletcher has
said, ‘all the way from exalted mysticism through
mere gallantry, to mocking cynicism.’ Although these
moods all flourished in the foreign salons of various
periods, they never became in England the peculiar
attributes of salon life as distinct from mere social
customs. They passed on to the salons of the Restoration
little more than a general tradition of Platonic
and pastoral mannerism and a handful of classical
pseudonyms useful to the conventionally amorous.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When with the Restoration the feminine influence
on the current of literature emerges once more, it is
again changed in aspect—like everything else. So
far as the destinies of the English salon are concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the Restoration marks no real advance. If there is
not an actual loss of ground, there is at least a change
of direction. Women now become aspirants to an
independent literary reputation. The groups which
literary women formed about themselves never quite
suggest the atmosphere of the salon, for their aims
seldom give evidence of a desire to approach literature
from the social side.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> It was no longer the ambition
of woman to rule the world of letters from above or
from beyond as a sort of Muse by whose aid and in
whose honour all was to be done, but to enter that
world herself and there to claim equality with man.
It was again only a shift of emphasis, but it was sufficient
to destroy the social aspect of the salon. A
salon is not a school of professionals.</p>

<p>It seems strange that the Parisian salon should not
have been imported bodily by the returning courtiers.
A French salon was for a time conducted at court, as
we shall see; but it was not brought there through
English influence, and always remained a foreign
growth, not even adopting the English language.
English literary women, despite the presence of this
model, seem to have been incapable of creating anything
more than a circle of friends, cordially interested
in their literary ambitions, but hardly considering
the coterie the highest social expression of the literary
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>The nearest approach to salon life in this period
is the coterie formed by the ‘matchless Orinda,’
Mrs. Katherine Philips. This amiable young woman,
with a gift for versifying and a truly social instinct,
achieved no slight reputation in her own day. At
Cardigan Priory, her Welsh estate, she conducted
something very like a salon. ‘She instituted,’ says
Mr. Gosse,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> ‘a Society of Friendship to which male and
female members were admitted, and in which poetry,
religion and the human heart were to form the subjects
of discussion.’ Here is the salon spirit and a reliance
on conversation as the truest inspiration to social life—a
thing which we shall not encounter again till the
days of the bluestockings. Orinda adopted the prevalent
custom of giving literary names to her friends,
indulged in Platonic friendships of the most florid
kind, praised her female friends in verse, and despatched
glowing sentiments to them in letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I gasp for you with an impatience that is not to be
imagined by any soul wound up to a less concern in
friendship than yours is, and therefore I cannot hope
to make others sensible of my vast desires to enjoy
you.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whatever interest Mrs. Philips’s works may possess
must be shared with this group, with ‘Rosania,’
‘Lucasia,’ ‘Poliarchus,’ and the rest, for to them a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
proportion of her writing was directly addressed. It
is to be regretted that we are not more fully informed
regarding the relations of certain eminent men with
the coterie. The general interest felt by the Royalist
poets in her career has been taken to point to a personal
connection with her, but it is doubtful whether
the relations of such men as Dryden, Cowley, and
Denham with her were anything more than formally
courteous. To them she was a new phenomenon in
the literary world, a female author, a prodigy that
attracted attention but did not threaten rivalry—a
woman and therefore to be flattered, a poetess and
therefore to be called a tenth Muse. Cowley, who
equates her with Pope Joan, is almost comic in his
praise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">But if Apollo should design</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">A woman laureat to make,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But this is <ins class="corr" id="tn-92" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'elegy, nor burlesque'">
elegy, not burlesque</ins>.</p>

<p>With Jeremy Taylor, ‘Palæmon,’ the case is different.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
In 1657 he put forth a duodecimo volume entitled
<cite>A Discourse of the Nature, Offices and Measures of
Friendship</cite>, which, the title-page announces, was
‘written in answer to a Letter from the most ingenious
and vertuous M. K. P.’ Orinda had written to Taylor,
with whom she must have been already on terms of
intimacy, to inquire ‘how far a dear and perfect friendship
is authorized by the principles of Christianity.’
The answer is a wholly delightful essay which was
widely popular in the seventeenth century and deserves
to be more generally known to-day. Taylor
praises Mrs. Philips as ‘not only greatly instructed by
the direct notices of things, but also by great experience
in the matter of which you now inquire.’ He concludes
that it is not ill that she should ‘entertain brave
friendships and worthy societies’; but takes occasion to
warn her against the fantastic Platonism of the salon:<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They that build castles in the aire, and look upon
friendship, as upon a fine Romance, a thing that pleases
the fancy, but is good for nothing else will doe well
when they are asleep, or when they come to Elysium;
and for ought I know in the mean time may be as
much in love with <em>Mandana</em> in the <em>Grand Cyrus</em>, as
with the <em>Countess of Exeter</em>; and by dreaming of perfect
and abstracted friendships, make them so immaterial
that they perish in the handling and become
good for nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>In the postscript to Mrs. Philips, she is requested to
forward the essay to Dr. Wedderburn, if she ‘shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
think it fit that these pass further’ than her own ‘eye
and closet.’ Such was Taylor’s trust in Orinda; such
his tribute to her.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Orinda’s relations with
the authors of her time are little short of remarkable.
Her name is written across some of the most characteristic
poetry of the age. When she was but twenty,
commendatory verses by her were prefixed to the Poems
of Vaughan the Silurist. Before the end of her short
life—she died in 1664, soon after her thirty-fourth
birthday—she had even attracted the notice of Dryden.
Her contemporaries appear to have been serious in
their belief that she had made herself a permanent
place in English literature, and for many years after
her death kept her fame alive by publishing her plays,
poems, and letters, in which she was invariably described
as ‘celebrated,’ ‘matchless,’ and ‘incomparable.’
Her coterie made but little impression on the literature
of its time; but that may well have been due to its
short career. Mrs. Philips possessed a refinement of
taste and of character by no means common among
the literary ladies of the time, and a noble though
highly sentimental affection for her friends. These are
characteristics which, had she lived, she might have
made of practical advantage to the world of letters.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On a somewhat lower social plane the notorious Mrs.
Aphra Behn carried on the traditions of the matchless
Orinda. Like her, Mrs. Behn had her coterie which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
she celebrated in conventional lyrics. In the poem
entitled <cite>Our Cabal</cite>, the various members are described
under pastoral pseudonyms, Alexis, Damon, Amoret,
and the like. It is impossible to identify the persons
referred to, but it is unlikely that any of them attained
to literary fame. Gallantry, coquetry, and the whole
paraphernalia of the amatory art formed the exclusive
business of the coterie. With the world of letters it
had little to do. Thus it touches the salon upon its
least important side. But Mrs. Behn, or ‘Astræa,’
as her friends rashly called her, developed another
side by emulating the practice of Mlle. Scudéry, and
weaving certain of her own adventures—for she had
had many—into the body of her novels. This practice
of colouring the events of an interminable romance
with personal allusions and allegorical meanings was
one of the principal results of salon activity in Paris
during the later seventeenth century; but it is not
characteristic of the salon at its finest and was, so far
as English literature was concerned, but a fad which
had no future at all. Moreover Mrs. Behn’s romances
lack what is best in the type, that courtliness which
can alone redeem such works from artificiality and
dulness. It is true that Mrs. Behn escapes dulness,
but she does not achieve courtliness. Thus she misses
the very point at which such work may come under the
influence of fine society. As it is, far from serving the
cause of literature by attracting authors to the urbanities
of life, her scandalous novels brought both their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
author and her profession into disrepute. Her unique
achievement was to show that a woman could make
her living by her pen. Her career brought her inevitably
into touch and even into competition with
male authors, and her easy manners enabled her to
associate on terms of pleasant familiarity with Dryden
and Otway; but all this is suggestive rather of the
<i lang="fr">camaraderie</i> of the modern literary world than of the
atmosphere of salons.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile Hortense, Duchess of Mazarin, and niece
of the Cardinal of that name, had set up in London
a genuine French salon. It owes its somewhat
exotic fame entirely to the Chevalier de Saint Évremond
who wrote of its mistress in language of the most
riotous hyperbole. Some of the best-known pages
of this amorous old wit were produced in honour of the
fair French refugee at the court of Charles II. He
wrote poems to her; he wrote a ‘portrait’ of her, in
which her charms are analysed in such detail as almost
to indicate a state of dotage in him; to satisfy a whim
of hers he wrote a Funeral Oration for her while she
was yet alive that she might see her praises set forth
in the manner of Bossuet. He wrote a discourse on
religion to embody the thoughts which she had drawn
out during a conversation in her salon. In a letter
to her, which accompanied the essay, he asserts that
she has given the lie to the old statement that truth
must be banished from ordinary conversation, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
she can make truth so attractive as to reconcile all
minds to it and restore it to its proper place in the
world.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But all this is a mere speck in the avalanche
of flattery. Her conversation, he assures her elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
surpasses Plutarch in gravity, Seneca in sententiousness,
and Montaigne in depth.</p>

<p>But the philosophic goddess and her withered
prophet were not always happy together. The Duchess
was overfond of bassette, a game in which Saint
Évremond indulged chiefly to please her, lamenting
the loss of her conversation the while, and addressing
poetical protests to her. The passion for gaming,
which threatened to become a profession or a fury
with her, is less revolting than the <i lang="fr">amours</i> in which
the lady (more beautiful than Helen or Cleopatra<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>)
involved herself. The fascination of the Merry Monarch
and the death of a favourite lover after a duel
fought with an infatuated nephew, bring her love-affairs
out of the Platonic atmosphere, so essential to
salons, into the realm of ugly realism.</p>

<p>The salon Mazarin, which came to an end with the
death of the Duchess in 1699, thus tended to associate
the literary hostess with vice as well as with letters.
As Mrs. Behn had degraded the name of woman in
the world of hack-writers, so the Duchess of Mazarin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
degraded it in the drawing-room. Her salon represented
a vicious and a foreign institution, which,
though it gained a foothold at Court, was quite without
influence upon English life and literature.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the death of the Duchess of Mazarin we reach
the end of the seventeenth century and the end of anything
like a salon in England until the time of the
bluestockings. The results of the feminist movement
at the close of that century<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> are seen in two distinct
yet definitely related facts. In the first place, a large
number of women were encouraged, by the success of
Mrs. Behn, to attempt the production of literature,
and the female author and wit became a current subject
of satire. With all this we have here nothing to
do. Women like Catherine Trotter, Mary Pix, and
Mrs. Manley, far from promoting the social recognition
of literature, tended to deflect the influence of
woman from the drawing-room to the noise and strife
of Grub Street. The satire that was poured out on
them and their kind as learned women must not be
taken to point to the existence of anything like a salon,
strictly considered. Terms borrowed from French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
literature were freely flung about; but references to
<i lang="fr">ruelles</i> and <i lang="fr">femmes savantes</i> were so loosely used that they
are not to be thought of having the same significance
when repeated by English authors that they have in
their own country.</p>

<p>In the second place, and largely as a result of the
opinion in which such female wits were held, we find
a mass of tracts, consisting of Defences of, Apologies
for, and Serious Proposals to Women, all working
towards a vindication of the sex. Such vindications
frequently strike the reader as having been written
to prove the very charges which they exist to rebut.
In any case, this flood of feeble defences seems to show
that woman had forgotten her high office as inspirer
and patron of letters, which she had hitherto always
taken for granted, and had decided to occupy herself
with vague questions of equality and natural capacity.
We have moved far from the spacious times of the
Countess of Pembroke.</p>

<p>In the age of Anne, English women lost what was
probably the best chance they ever had to reëstablish
the feminine patronage of letters which distinguished
the age of Elizabeth. The tone of urbanity which
characterized the literature of the early eighteenth
century ought to have given birth to salons. The
presence of a Stuart queen upon the throne and the
supremacy of a school of authors by no means averse
from social pleasures, offered a unique opportunity to
women to give social expression to their interest in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
literature and to inspire and assist authors. But the
opportunity was lost. Feminine activity in the literary
world continued to be associated with notorious
names, with the scurrilous <cite>New Atlantis</cite> of Mary Manley,
and with the loose career of Mrs. Centlivre. Women
authors were already Bohemians. ‘In the female
world,’ says Johnson in his <cite>Life of Addison</cite>, ‘any
acquaintance with books was distinguished only to be
censured.’</p>

<p>This pronouncement of Johnson’s is of that large
general nature which is likely to give offence to specialists.
A multitude of exceptions to it will occur at
once to any one. The Duchess of Queensbury, for
example, patronized Gay; Dean Swift was not uninfluenced
by the women who surrounded him; Pope
addressed verse-epistles to Martha Blount; later in the
century, Young satirized the literary female, and
Richardson had his group of adoring ‘Daughters.’
But none of these really changes the significance of
Johnson’s summary. When he referred to the censure
visited upon literary women he may well have been
thinking of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose
acquaintance with the authors of her time was wider
than that ever possessed by the bluestockings. But
though the noble lady had genuine interest in letters
and very remarkable powers, she was wholly without
that courtly character which is indispensable to the
hostess of a salon. She repelled men as much by her
insolent cleverness as by her slovenly manners. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
her long residence abroad withdrew her completely
from the literary circle which she knew so well.</p>

<p>It was the work of the middle decades of the eighteenth
century to remove the odium in which women’s
interest in literature had been held. The world of
female readers became almost as large and influential
as that of the male, so that by 1778 Johnson could
remark, ‘All our ladies read now.’ The Bluestocking
Club, which marks the first definite reappearance of
the salon in London, shows the desire of woman to
extend her function in the literary world so as to
include in it the office of patron, as well as that of
author and reader. But this new patronage was to be
primarily social, and was to express itself first in various
social diversions, which preluded the more formal
salons, and to which we now proceed.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="smcap">Conversation Parties and Literary Assemblies</span></h3>

<p>Not the least pleasant of the social gatherings for
conversation was the levee, or reception held on rising
from bed. The custom was of course adopted by
people of fashion in imitation of the popular court
function, and it always retained something of the
courtly atmosphere, its popularity in fine society being
due to the sense of importance which it lent to the
host or hostess. Madame de Tencin, for example,
thus held court from eight o’clock in the morning,
queening it over everybody, ‘from the lowest tools to
the highest.’<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Mascarille, it will be remembered,
boasts that he never rises from bed without the company
of half a dozen <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>. Yet despite its
imitation of the court, there must have been about
this kind of reception a certain intimacy and ease that
were lacking in the more formal assemblies held later
in the day.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Levee</span><br>
From an engraving of the fourth painting in Hogarth’s <cite>Marriage à la Mode</cite></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In England the levee had been known for perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
a hundred years;<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> but it first becomes of importance
to the student of literature about the middle of the
century. A good general impression of it may be
obtained from the fourth plate of Hogarth’s <cite>Marriage
à la Mode</cite>, published in 1745. The hostess, half
dressed, is seated at her toilet-table, under the ministrations
of her hair-dresser, and is engaged in conversation
with her lover, who is reclining on a sofa
near by. In the background is seen the bed, one curtain
of which is still drawn. A negro butler is passing
chocolate to the guests who are ranged in front of the
bed, while an Italian tenor is regaling them with solos
to the accompaniment of a flute. This latter point is
significant in the satire, for it is evident that the
hostess is incapable of conducting a true conversazione,
and has therefore had recourse to providing her guests
with other entertainment, while she pursues her
amorous intrigue.</p>

<p>A later and even more familiar representation of the
levee is found at the opening of the <cite>School for Scandal</cite>,
where Lady Sneerwell is ‘discovered’ at her toilet.
When this scene is correctly represented on the stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the lady’s guests are shown as drinking chocolate at her
levee, and there characteristically displaying their
conversational gifts.</p>

<p>That the levee was at its best essentially a literary
function is shown by the encouragement it received
from Samuel Johnson. The account of his morning
receptions is preserved for us by Dr. Maxwell, whose
description must be quoted in full:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About twelve o’clock I commonly visited him, and
frequently found him in bed, or declaiming over his
tea, which he drank very plentifully. He generally
had a levee of morning visitors, chiefly men of letters;
Hawkesworth, Goldsmith, Murphy, Langton, Steevens,
Beauclerk, etc., etc., and sometimes learned ladies,
particularly I remember a French lady of wit and fashion
doing him the honour of a visit.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> He seemed to
be considered as a kind of public oracle, whom everybody
thought they had a right to visit and consult;
and doubtless they were well rewarded.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When Johnson visited Boswell in Edinburgh after
the tour of the Hebrides ‘he had, from ten o’clock to
one or two, a constant levee of various persons, of
different characters and descriptions;’ so that poor
Mrs. Boswell was obliged to ‘devote the greater part of
the morning to the endless task of pouring out tea.’<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>This custom, thus sanctioned by fashion and by
literary authority, was adopted by all who pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
to wit. In 1760, Goldsmith sneers at the philosophical
beau who ‘receives company in his study, in all the
pensive formality of slippers, night-gown, and easy-chair.’<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>

</div>

<p class="noindent">By 1779 the function had become so popular that its
name was frequently extended to any formal entertainment
where conversation was the principal attraction,
even when it was held in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The levee merged easily into the formal breakfast.
This function might occur at any hour from eight
o’clock in the morning to three in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> It
was in 1750 that Madame du Bocage recorded her
impressions of Mrs. Montagu’s breakfasts, generalizing
upon the custom of the nation in these words:</p>

<p>The diaries and letters of Beattie, Mrs. Delany, Miss
Burney, and Miss More are strewn with references to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
this fashionable meal. In the spring of 1774, Walpole
professes himself frightened at the inundation of them
coming on.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> A favourite diversion at these matutinal
parties, as at entertainments later in the day, was the
declamation of Thomas Sheridan (who would repeat
Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite>, Dryden’s <cite>Ode</cite>, and ‘everything that
everybody could say by heart’<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>), the French readings
of Tessier, the tragic recitations of Tighe (who expected
his auditors to swoon from emotion), and, occasionally,
bits of recitation or acting by Garrick. Sheridan
gave so many of these literary breakfasts that Mrs.
Boscawen suspected that he received money for them.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
At times such functions were more or less public, and
were held in the Haymarket, at Vauxhall, or at Bath,
in the Assembly Rooms.</p>

<p>The receptions of the later afternoon and evening
are of a less definite character. Beattie describes a
gathering at Mrs. Montagu’s as ‘an assembly or conversation
or rout.’<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The entertainment was of wide
scope, as in Italian and French drawing-rooms, and
might include dancing, card-playing, and literary
readings, as well as conversation.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In this work we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
are concerned only with the literary aspect of these
parties; the origin and the more serious results of the
London salon are discussed elsewhere, so that the rest
of this chapter may be devoted to a consideration of
the means adopted for shining in conversation at these
parties, and the attempt to connect such assemblies
directly with the production of poetry.</p>

<p>It is surely a misfortune that contemporary descriptions
of the conversazione should be generally satirical
in tone; but it is natural enough, for conversation,
unsupported by other entertainment, tends, in large
groups, to pedantry on the one hand, and to frivolousness
on the other. English literature produced no
Molière to satirize the salons; but the conversazione
did give both character and title to one great comedy,
the <cite>School for Scandal</cite>. Although this play is not,
like the <cite lang="fr">Critique de l’École des Femmes</cite>, an adequate
criticism of the literary drawing-room, it does nevertheless
preserve prominent aspects of it, and we shall
have occasion to refer to it repeatedly in illustrating
the nature of the conversazione.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Another criticism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
of this entertainment is found in a book now totally
forgotten, entitled, <cite>Modern Manners, or the Country
Cousins, in a series of Poetical Epistles</cite>. This is the
work of the Rev. Samuel Hoole, son of the translator
of Tasso and Ariosto, and appeared in the year 1782.
The poems describe the visit of a north-English family
to London, somewhat after the manner of Smollett in
<cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>, and of Anstey in the <cite>New Bath
Guide</cite>. The tenth epistle is an account of Lady Chattony’s
conversazione.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> At that assembly old Mr.
Ralph Rusty is served with lukewarm coffee and tea
and a minute bit of cake, which made him long for
more. The company splits up into groups, each with
their backs turned on the rest. The first party which
he joins is (naturally) talking scandal:</p>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Rusty’s unhappy evening was concluded by listening
to the tales of a young lord just returned from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
travels, a buck who wishes to fight a duel with him
because he laughs at incredible stories.</p>

<p>There is nothing very witty in this poem, as the
quotations may show; and the satires no doubt sank
of their own weight; but in spite of its dulness, the
account would appear to be, in the main, a fair picture
of the conversazione. We may notice, in the first
place, that Lady Chattony has followed the best traditions
of the salon in reducing her refreshments to a
minimum, depending for the success of her reception
entirely upon the conversation of her guests.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The
talk, again, is not confined to a large circle; but is
broken up, after Mrs. Vesey’s manner, into a series of
small groups. We have the usual references to gossip,
scandal, and chatter about clothes, politics, and the
opera, with occasional approaches to Sheridan’s method
of satire, but with none of his cleverness.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that any satire on the conversazione
should dwell on the tendency to scandal and gossip.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
So inevitable is their presence in the salons that it
seems hardly necessary to point it out; but it is essential
to be at the true explanation of their prevalence,
which no satire is likely to point out. Scandal, and
its sister, Gossip, are the short cuts to cleverness, and
cleverness is the one indispensable thing to the frequenters
of salons. This is abundantly evident in the
<cite>School for Scandal</cite>. It is wit for which Lady Sneerwell’s
guests are striving, and they will mar a character
that they may make a <i lang="fr">mot</i>. ‘There is no possibility,’
says Lady Sneerwell, ‘of being witty without a little
ill-nature; the malice of a good thing is the barb that
makes it stick,’<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and Lady Teazle is in practical agreement
with her; ‘I vow I bear no malice against the
people I abuse; when I say an ill-natured thing ’tis
out of pure good humour.’</p>

<p>Sheridan was not the only dramatist to satirize the
salons and their scandalous talk. His comedy was
imitated by Thomas Holcroft in <cite>Seduction</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> a play
whose popularity on the stage was equalled by its popularity
in print. The conversation descriptive of an
assembly at Lady Morden’s is in obvious imitation
of the Scandal School.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neginx">
<em>Sir Frederic.</em> &#160; Sir Nathan Neaptide, the yellow admiral, came.</p>

<p class="neginx">

<p class="neginx">
<em>Sir Frederic.</em> &#160; The widow Twinkle, as usual, talked a vast deal
                       about reputation.</p>
<p class="neginx">
<em>Lady Morden.</em>  &#160; One is apt to admire a thing one wants.</p>
<p class="neginx">
<em>Lord Morden.</em>  &#160; She always takes infinite pains to place her
                       reputation, like broken china in a buffet, with the
                       best side outward.</p>
<p class="neginx">
<em>Lady Morden.</em>  &#160; She may plaister, and cement, but will never bring
                       it to bear handling.</p>
</div>

<p>Other aspirants to conversational fame adopted the
less questionable habit of talking sentiments. Here
again the <cite>School for Scandal</cite> reveals the trick of the
salons, for Joseph Surface has won himself a place in
the group by virtue of his philosophical and ethical
maxims. Sheridan’s brilliant satire of a reigning fad
in literature and society was anticipated by Goldsmith
in <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite>, in which, when Kate Hardcastle
wishes to speak like a fine lady, she at once begins
to talk sentiments.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> This habit of lending a semblance
of depth to one’s conversation by the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
of philosophical aphorisms is no doubt as old as the
salon itself. At its best, there is nothing contemptible
in the sentiment, as the long and brilliant history of
the maxim in French literature may prove. The reputation
of Mme. de Sablé’s salon was largely made
by the maxim or <i lang="fr">pensée</i>, and all the later salons afford
examples of its vitality. Madame Geoffrin was famous
for it. ‘Madame Geoffrin,’ wrote Mme. Necker,
‘a mis toute sa raison en maximes,’<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and the same
writer praises the work of English authors for their
successful production of this type, finding these authors
otherwise deficient in moral principles.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The maxim,
ethical sentiment, or philosophical truth sententiously
expressed, did indeed attain substantial existence in
the essays of Samuel Johnson, who fancied that mankind
might come in time to ‘write all aphoristically;’
but in English conversation it never found a thoroughly
congenial soil. ‘Sentiments’ were popular, but, like
much that was popular, they were hollow too. The
Dowager Countess Gower writes to Mrs. Delany that
the bluestockings are at Sunning Wells, where they
‘sport sentiments from morn tell noon, from noon to
dewy eve.’<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The pages of the <cite>Wit’s Magazine</cite> teemed
with collections of them: ‘Flattery, like a cameleon,
assumes the colours of the object it is nearest to.’
The record of bluestocking maxims and sentiments
preserved in letters and diaries is amazing, but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
because of its brilliance. Mrs. Montagu wrote the
following to Miss Burney, in reference to the character
of Mr. Vesey, ‘A frippery character, like a gaudy flower,
may please while it is in bloom; but it is the virtuous
only that, like the aromatics, preserve their sweet and
reviving odour when withered.’<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> This is exactly in the
style of Julia, the once-fashionable heroine of <cite>The
Rivals</cite>, who, in respect of her conversation, might be
own sister to Joseph Surface: ‘When hearts deserving
of happiness would unite their fortunes, Virtue would
crown them with an unfading garland of modest hurtless
flowers; but ill-judging Passion will force the
gaudier Rose into the wreath, whose thorn offends
them when its leaves are dropped.’</p>

<p>Closely akin to the neatly-turned sentiment is the
epigram and this, in all its forms, the salon, following
Continental models, sought to stimulate. One thinks
immediately of the poetical epigrams of Sir Benjamin
Backbite, his impromptu verses on Lady Frizzle’s
feather catching fire, his rebuses, the charade which he
made at Mrs. Drowsie’s conversazione, and, above all,
of that sprightly extempore conceit on Lady Betty
Curricle’s ponies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sure never were seen two such beautiful ponies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Other horses are Clowns—and these macaronies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, to give ’em this title I’m sure isn’t wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their legs are so slim and their tails<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> are so long.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">There was no more certain way of achieving a reputation
for wit than by the impromptu composition of
these little verses. No lover of Goldsmith will fail to
remember Garrick’s epigram on the poet who ‘wrote
like an angel and talked like poor Poll.’ Less hackneyed
is the couplet which Dr. Young produced at the
‘World,’ a club of gentlemen who were amusing themselves
after dinner by scratching verses, with their
diamonds, upon the wine-glasses. Having no jewel
of his own, Young, when his turn came round, was
obliged to borrow Chesterfield’s, and then wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Accept a miracle: instead of wit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See two dull lines with Stanhope’s pencil writ.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is difficult to find a volume of eighteenth century
verse that does not bear witness to the popularity of
the epigram. Every miscellany teems with them.
No collected edition of poems was complete without a
handful of them. They are recorded in every diary
and commonplace-book, and were exchanged by friends
in the course of familiar correspondence. High and
low, the peer of wit and the pretender to it, vied with
one another in the production of them. All alike seem
to have reached a dead level of mediocrity. The
charade which Johnson made in honour of his friend
Dr. Barnard<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> is no better and no worse than scores of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
impromptu verses quoted in Walpole’s <cite>Letters</cite> or the
<cite>Asylum for Fugitive Pieces</cite>.</p>

<p>Much of this, no doubt, seems trivial. But wherever
the spirit of the salon appears, evidence of its presence
is seen in the production and general esteem of such
trifles: rebuses, anagrams, madrigals, enigmas, charades,
and <i lang="fr">bouts rimés</i>. The explanation of it all goes
back, perhaps, to the Italian Renaissance, when, as
Burckhardt has shown, an epigram could lay the foundation
of a scholar’s celebrity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was held the greatest of all triumphs when an
epigram was mistaken for a genuine copy from some
old marble or when it was so good that all Italy learned
it by heart, as happened in the case of some of Bembo’s.</p>
</div>

<p>The popularity of epigrams in fine English society
is amusingly illustrated by the entertainments provided
by a certain Mrs. (afterwards Lady) Miller at
her villa near Bath. The character and the results of
her attempt to stimulate the production of literature
are typical, and, as they have left a considerable record
in print, it may be profitable to consider them somewhat
at length. She introduced what she was pleased to
term the ‘little Gallic institution’ of <i lang="fr">bouts rimés</i>. Lists
of riming words were distributed among her guests,
who composed verses suggested by them, employing
them in their given order. The resulting effusions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
were then placed in a vase decorated with laurel
branches and pink ribbons, erected upon a ‘modern
altar.’ ‘It is at present,’ writes this ingenious lady,
‘the receptacle of all the contending poetical morsels
which every other Thursday (formerly Friday) are
drawn out of it indiscriminately, and read aloud by the
gentlemen present, each in his turn. Their particular
merits are afterwards discussed by them, and prizes
assigned to three out of the whole that appear to be
the most deserving. Their authors are then, and not
before, called for, who seldom fail to be <em>announced</em>
either by themselves, or, if absent, by their friends.
Then the prize poems are read aloud a second time
to the company, each by its author, if present, if
not, by other Gentlemen, and wreaths of Myrtle presented
publicly by the Institutress<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> to each successful
writer.’</p>

<p>When these verses were published they roused, if
not the general esteem which the Institutress plainly
expected for them, the interest of Miss Burney, the
curiosity of Boswell, and the mirth of Walpole. The
latter wrote, in his most delightful mood, to the Countess
of Ailesbury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You must know, Madam, that near Bath is erected
a new Parnassus, composed of three laurels, a myrtle-tree,
a weeping-willow, and a view of the Avon, which
has been new christened Helicon. Ten years ago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
there lived a Madam Riggs, an old rough humourist
who passed for a wit; her daughter, who passed for
nothing, married to a Captain Miller, full of good-natured
officiousness. These good folks were friends
of Miss Rich, who carried me to dine with them at
Bath-Easton, now Pindus. They caught a little of
what was then called taste, built and planted, and
begot children, till the whole caravan were forced to
go abroad to retrieve. Alas! Mrs. Miller is returned
a beauty, a genius, a Sappho, a tenth Muse, as romantic
as Mademoiselle Scudéri, and as sophisticated as Mrs.
Vesey. The Captain’s fingers are loaded with cameos,
his tongue runs over with <i lang="la">virtù</i>, and that both may contribute
to the improvement of their own country, they
have introduced <i lang="fr">bouts rimés</i> as a new discovery. They
hold a Parnassus fair every Thursday, give out rhymes
and themes, and all the flux of quality at Bath contend
for the prizes. A Roman vase dressed with pink ribbons
and myrtles receives the poetry, which is drawn
out every festival; six judges of these Olympic games
retire and select the brightest compositions, which
the respective successful acknowledge, kneel to Mrs.
Calliope Miller, kiss her fat hand, and are crowned by
it with myrtle, with—I don’t know what. You
may think this is fiction or exaggeration. Be dumb,
unbelievers! The collection is printed, published.—Yes,
on my faith! There are <i lang="fr">bouts rimés</i> on a
buttered muffin, made by her Grace the Duchess of
Northumberland; receipts to make them by Corydon
the venerable, <em>alias</em> George Pitt; others very pretty
by Lord Palmerston; some by Lord Carlisle: many
by Mrs. Miller herself, that have no fault but wanting
metre: and immortality promised to her without end
or measure.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Miller’s Institution appears, however, to have
been an unqualified social success. The first edition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the verses was exhausted in ten days,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and a second
was published in the following year. Three similar
volumes appeared at intervals,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and the series was terminated
only by the death of the Institutress.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The
publications received the compliment of an anonymous
attack entitled <cite>Sappho</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> in which Mrs. Miller was
satirically hailed as ‘Mistress of the tuneful nine’;
but a more deadly assault took the form of a solemn
congratulatory <cite>Epistle to Mrs. Miller</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> in which that
lady is said to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">Shine unmatched in old or modern time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A friend of Genius, Pleasure, Taste and Rhime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which daily thrive beneath thy fostering hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pour the tide of learning o’er the land.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">An examination of the volume published in 1775 hardly
seems to bear out these statements. The following
production of the hostess herself it is difficult to describe
with accuracy, for the word verse hardly seems appropriate
to it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>It is only fair to say that the verses in the volume
do frequently rise from this level to that of mediocrity.
The following specimen of <i lang="fr">bouts rimés</i> may serve to
indicate the type and contents of the volume:</p>

</table>

<p>There are other things to be said in amelioration of
the harsh judgments one is inclined to pass upon Mrs.
Miller. The later volumes are certainly less bad than
the first. The praise of Mrs. Miller, which had formed
the staple of the first volume, is somewhat mitigated in
the others, and the names of the contributors occasionally
emerge into the borderland of fame. Potter,
William Hayley, Anna Seward, and Christopher
Anstey are worthy of respect, and a poem by Garrick,
though worthless, lends a certain distinction to the
second volume. Anstey’s poem, <cite>An Election Ball</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
which enjoyed something of the popularity of his
<cite>New Bath Guide</cite>, was written upon a subject given out
by Mrs. Miller, ‘The ancient and modern Dress and
Manners of the English Nation compared’; and the
<cite>Poetical Address</cite> which prefaced it is addressed to Mr.
Miller. In the former ‘Clio’ and the Tusculan ‘vause’
are celebrated, and in the latter the ‘myrtle sprigs’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
and ‘vocal swans of Bath.’ These poems are still
readable.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Miller must certainly be allowed the merit
of having gathered about herself a group of persons
who would have made the reputation of any London
drawing-room. Her own inability to produce anything
that should have more than the external appearance of
verse does not seem to have repelled those of higher
ability and finer taste. For such a woman it was in the
nature of an achievement that her Institution lasted
six years; and the four volumes of so-called poetical
contributions to it retain a certain melancholy interest
as showing the result of a deliberate attempt by the
world of fashion to stimulate the production of poetry.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="smcap">The Bluestocking Club</span></h3>

<p>The list of bluestocking ladies given by Hannah
More in her poem, <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite>, is as follows: ‘Vesey of
verse the judge and friend,’ ‘Boscawen sage,’ ‘bright
Montagu,’ and Elizabeth Carter. To this we should
of course add the name of Miss More herself. The
men enumerated as members are Lord Lyttelton,
Pultney, Earl of Bath, and Horace Walpole. Exactly
the same list is given by Forbes in his <cite>Life of Beattie</cite>,
save that he adds the name of Stillingfleet. Miss
More mentions certain famous men as former habitués
of the blue drawing-room, Garrick, Mason, Dr. Johnson,
Burke (‘apostate now from social wit’), and Sir William
Pepys. These five, with the exception of Pepys, are
thought of rather as frequent visitors than as recognized
members.</p>

<p>We must not assume from the use of the word <em>club</em>
the existence of a formally established society, like the
great Literary Club, with rules and election of members.
The blues were drawn together simply by the desire
for mutual intercourse, and the group expanded freely
as fit associates appeared. No exact list of bluestockings
can therefore be made. Indeed, the list of
ladies in Hannah More’s <cite>Sensibility</cite>, described as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
participating in ‘the charm of friendship and the feast
of sense,’ is somewhat different from the one already
quoted: Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Montagu,
Mrs. Chapone, Mrs. Walsingham, Mrs. Delany, and
Mrs. Barbauld. Fanny Burney, like Miss More herself,
is thought of as a younger member,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> almost as a
protégée of the club. Mrs. Thrale, with her own
coterie, was always more or less of an outsider, as
was also Mrs. Ord. Later, as we shall see, the name
<em>bluestocking</em> came to be applied to women who had
only the remotest connection with the original group.</p>

<p>The origin of the little company which was to develop
into the <i lang="fr">Bas Bleu</i> is now difficult to discover. Miss
More’s poem in praise of it did not appear until 1786,
many years after its fame was fully established. The
verses, begun in 1783, circulated for many months in
manuscript and frequently retouched, are the official
handbook of the society; but it is necessary to remember
that the author did not come into contact with the
group during its earlier history, and that her account
of its origin is therefore not to be taken as indubitable
evidence. She divides the honour of having instituted
the bluestocking <i lang="it">conversazioni</i> between Mrs. Montagu
and Mrs. Boscawen. Madame D’Arblay, on the other
hand, assigns it exclusively to Mrs. Vesey.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> In any
case, it is certain that Mrs. Montagu speedily became
the leading person in the club, for Lyttelton, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
as early as 1765,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> refers to her as ‘la belle présidente.’
The earliest meetings may well have occurred at her
literary breakfasts, which have been already described.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
It is not unreasonable to assume that the ‘club’ was
already in existence during the later fifties, for it was
well known to Admiral Boscawen, who died in 1761.
A prominent member of it, mentioned by Miss More,
was the Earl of Bath, who died in 1764. But the
Bas Bleu did not attain the meridian of its fame till
many years later.</p>

<p>From its very beginning the object of the club was
to promote literary conversation as the chief pleasure
of social life. That such conversation was a stiff and
solemn business one hardly needs to be told. Bluestocking
letters alone are a sufficient proof of it. In
the <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite> we hear much of the false wit of the Hôtel
de Rambouillet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where wit and point and equivoque</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Distorted every word they spoke.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The English bluestockings will have none of this.
They repudiate wit that is French and wit that is
tainted, and exalt common sense in its stead. Hannah
More declares that the solid basis of conversation is
learning; it is for conversation, she cries, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sage consumes his midnight toil;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And keeps his vigils to produce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Materials for thy future use.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Such praise of serious conversation enables us to guess
at the preparation which earnest souls made for the
<i lang="it">conversazioni</i> in which they hoped to shine. To Lady
Louisa Stuart the group at Mrs. Montagu’s had about
it a suspicion of acting before an audience. ‘If you
had good luck,’ she says, ‘you might not only be
greatly amused at Mrs. Montagu’s, but carry away
much that was well worth remembering. But then,
also, the circular form is not less convenient to prosers
and people who love to hear themselves talk, so you
might, on the contrary, come in for the most tiresome
dissertations, the dullest long stories, the flattest jokes
anywhere to be found.’<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Lyttelton himself gave
similar testimony. Fanny Burney’s words seem to
show that the bluestockings were occasionally bored
with themselves: ‘I respect and esteem them,’ she writes
in April 1784, ‘but they require an exertion to which
I am not always inclined.’ There is, moreover, the
indirect evidence afforded by Boswell. The greatest
judge of conversation then living had been repeatedly
in the presence of the bluestockings; he never wearied
of expressing his admiration for them; he had watched
them swarming about his master; he had taken the
trouble to investigate the origin of their society; but
he never thought it worth while to record their
talk.</p>

<p>Much of the fame of the bluestockings was due to
the name by which they had come to be known. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
caught the public attention quickly, and has remained
a useful addition to the English vocabulary. The
word <em>bluestocking</em> presents an interesting but perhaps
insoluble problem in etymology, or rather in slang.
Various explanations of the term exist, but, though
they are not irreconcilable, they are not wholly satisfactory.
It would seem as though a source ought to be
found in seventeenth century France or sixteenth
century Italy<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>; but none has yet come to light. Mills
in his <cite>History of Chivalry</cite><a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> (1825) traces the word
back to the Society ‘<span lang="it">de la Calza,</span>’ founded in Venice
in the year 1400. The society lasted till 1590, when,
he continues, ‘the rejected title’—by which presumably
he means <i lang="it">calza turchina</i>, though he nowhere mentions
it—‘crossed the Alps, and found a congenial
soil in the flippancy and literary triflings of Parisian
society.... It diverged from France to England.’
No evidence for the remarkable migrations of this
title is adduced by Mills. The words <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i> are
unknown to French lexicographers save as a translation
of the English bluestocking;<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> so that Mills’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
statements respecting the peregrinations of the term
seem to be the result of his own imagination.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, when we turn to English literature,
we find that the term was used as early as the
seventeenth century. The first occurrence of it noted
by Murray, in the <cite>New English Dictionary</cite>, is in Bramston’s
<cite>Autobiography</cite> (1683), in reference to the Little
Parliament of 1653: ‘That Blew-stocking Parliament.’
It is here plainly used as a sneer at the unostentatious
dress of the Puritans, who eschewed silk stockings.
Reference to coarse or ugly stockings had been a well-known
form of abuse for years. Prince Hal makes use of
a similar term, ‘puke-stocking’—puke being a kind of
bluish-black woollen, not worn by courtiers—in sneering
at the keeper of the Boar’s Head tavern.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The word
<em>bluestocking</em>, even after its application to literary ladies,
retained something of a derogatory flavour; it was considered
by some a term of reproach,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and was bitterly
resented.</p>

<p>Just when the term was first applied to literary
ladies, it is difficult to say;<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> the period of its great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
popularity was in the decade of the 80’s. By that
time it had caught the attention and roused the curiosity
of Boswell, who gives the following explanation of
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About this time [1781] it was much the fashion for
several ladies to have evening assemblies, where the
fair sex might participate in conversation with literary
and ingenious men, animated by a desire to please.
These societies were denominated Blue-stocking Clubs,
the origin of which title being little known, it may be
worth while to relate it. One of the most eminent
members of those societies, when they first commenced,
was Mr. Stillingfleet, whose dress was remarkably
grave, and in particular it was observed, that he wore
blue stockings. Such was the excellence of his conversation,
that his absence was felt as so great a loss
that it used to be said, ‘We can do nothing without
the <em>blue stockings</em>’ and thus by degrees the title was
established.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Forbes, in his <cite>Life of Beattie</cite>, throws new light on
the matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Stillingfleet, being somewhat of an humourist in
his habits and manners, and a little negligent in his
dress, literally wore grey stockings, from which circumstance,
Admiral Boscawen used, by way of pleasantry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
to call them the ‘Blue-Stocking Society,’ as if
to indicate that when these brilliant friends met, it
was not for the purpose of forming a dressed assembly.
A foreigner of distinction, hearing the expression,
translated it literally, ‘Bas Bleu,’ by which these
meetings came to be afterwards distinguished.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Madame D’Arblay, writing in 1832, asserted that it
was Mrs. Vesey who first encouraged Stillingfleet to
appear in his homely dress; ‘“Pho, pho,” cried she ...“don’t
mind dress! Come in your blue stockings!”’<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
and there seems to be no good reason for rejecting this
additional detail. It is at least not inconsistent with
the facts already cited.</p>

<p>The ‘mistake’ made by the ‘foreigner of distinction’
is plainly referred to in a letter from Mrs. Carter to
Mrs. Montagu, in reference to the title <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite>:
‘Do not you remember last winter that Madame de
Montier (or some such name; she was, however, the
French Ambassadress) desired somebody to introduce
Monsieur—son Mari to the Bas bleu?’<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>These explanations, which form a fairly consistent
series, and which commended themselves to the bluestockings,
ought to be good enough for the twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
century. Some, however, insist on a more picturesque
interpretation, probably in protest against the implication
that the first bluestocking was a man. An explanation
first offered in 1861 by Mr. Hayward, in the second
edition of his <cite>Autobiography of Mrs. Piozzi</cite>, was given
to him by a lady who said she received it from Lady
Crewe in the course of a conversation held in 1816.
It runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lady Crewe told me that her mother (Mrs. Greville),
the Duchess of Portland, and Mrs. Montagu were the
first who began the conversation parties in imitation
of the noted one, <em>temp.</em> Madame de Sévigné, at Rue St.
Honoré. Madame de Polignac, one of the first guests,
came in blue silk stockings, then the newest fashion
in Paris. Mrs. Greville and all the lady members of
Mrs. Montagu’s <em>club</em>, adopted the <em>mode</em>. A foreign
gentleman, after spending an evening at Mrs. Montagu’s
<i lang="fr">soirée</i>, wrote to tell a friend of the charming intellectual
party who had one rule; ‘they wear blue
stockings as a distinction.’</p>
</div>

<p>It would hardly be necessary to notice this account
at all, were it not that it has been seriously presented
in the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> as the correct
explanation, has been cited by an anonymous writer in
the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> (January 1903), and recently repeated
with full approval.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> It must be noticed, in the
first place, that Mr. Hayward himself does not accept
the story, inasmuch as he banishes it to a footnote, and
retains the traditional account in the body of his work.
Again, the sole source of his authority is the hearsay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
evidence of an anonymous lady given a century after
the fact. We are three stages away from the original
informant, without written evidence of any kind until
1816. Moreover, the anecdote bears upon its face all
the marks of a story <i lang="it">ben trovato</i>. Those who can think
of Mrs. Montagu and her friends as genially displaying
blue stockings as a sort of badge are, to say the
least, but ill acquainted with certain nice prejudices
of our literary ladies.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that there was about this
phrase that vague yet eloquent connotation which is the
peculiar property of slang and in which the explanations
given above are, with the exception of the last,
conspicuously deficient. In no other way can the
sudden popularity of the word be accounted for.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The
tendency to play with the phrase became evident at
once: ‘When will you <em>blue-stocking</em> yourself and come
amongst us?’ wrote Walpole to Hannah More.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
‘You may put on your blue stockings,’ wrote Mrs.
Chapone to Miss Burney,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> ‘if you have got any boots
to walk about in the mornings, I shall like you as well
in them.’ The word was of course presently reduced
to <em>blue</em>,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> partly, no doubt, because of the associations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of this colour with the salons ever since the Rambouillet
days. When Fanny Burney was asked what
Johnson called Mrs. Montagu, she replied, ‘“Queen,”
to be sure! “Queen of the Blues!”’<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and at court she
was amused at a gentleman who was ashamed to be
found ‘reading to <em>a blue</em>.’<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Two facts emerge clearly from these quotations.
In the first place, we derive from Mrs. Carter’s letter
a definite date for the origin of the phrase <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i>,
the winter of 1782-3. In the second place, it is obvious
that this French phrase and the anecdote connected
with it account in large measure for the popularity
of the word <em>bluestocking</em>. That word had, as
we have seen, existed before;<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> indeed the French lady
who first used the words <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i> was but trying to
translate an English phrase already familiar to her;
but it was only when that phrase assumed a kind of
international significance by appearing in French
form that the English public generally took up the
earlier word <em>bluestocking</em>. From 1782 onwards the
word becomes common. Moreover, it was at the same
period that public attention began to be directed to
the Bluestocking Club, and the date 1782 may conveniently
be taken as marking its florescence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="smcap">The London Salon</span></h3>

<p>The London salon corresponds well enough, in its
external aspects, with its Parisian prototype. If we
apply the fivefold analysis given in the second chapter
of this work, we shall discover no essential difference
in method between the two institutions. Differences
in result there undoubtedly were, but the two were
alike in aim. The London salon, like the Parisian, for
example, depended for its influence partly on the beauty
and interest of its material surroundings. Mrs.
Montagu fascinated her guests with Chinese rooms,
Athenian rooms, feather rooms, rooms decorated by
Angelica Kauffmann, and other gorgeous apartments
in her house in Hill Street and in her palace in Portman
Square. Mrs. Vesey, less ambitious and more intimate,
entertained her friends in a ‘blue-room’ or ‘green-room,’
and often in her little dressing-room which Mrs.
Carter called ‘the unostentatious receptacle of liberal
society’<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>—unostentatious, no doubt, but bizarre
and successfully bizarre like everything that Mrs.
Vesey touched.</p>

<p>Like the French hostesses, these women kept up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
their assemblies a tone that was at once aristocratic
and literary; they made conversation the chief entertainment
of the drawing-room, and the patronage of
letters their most elegant aim. Each of them attached
to herself—perhaps it would be more proper to say,
attached herself to—some writer, who frequently
repaid her friendship with tributes in verse. These
writers were, in general, women; and the friendships
of the London salon are usually, though not always,
feminine. They offer, therefore, as we shall see later,
a notable contrast to literary friendships in Parisian
salons.</p>

<p>Various English women—Mrs. Cholmondeley, Mrs.
Crewe, Lady Lucan, Lady Hervey, Mrs. Greville, Mrs.
Catherine Macaulay—had studied the Parisian salon
at first hand; but none of them were so familiar with
it, none so intimately acquainted with various Parisian
hostesses, as Mrs. Montagu. As early as 1750 Madame
du Bocage visited her in London and took breakfast
at her house in Hill Street. The two ladies paid elaborate
court to each other. Montagu presented du
Bocage with compliments and an edition of Milton,
and du Bocage (who was a professed poet) replied with
compliments and a string of riming couplets, setting
forth the merits of Montagu.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Again, when Madame Necker was in England, many
years later, Mrs. Montagu saw much of her. The
French lady, like every one, was pleased with her amiability,
and, again like every one, amused at the stiffness
of her conversation.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> When, in 1775, Mrs. Montagu
went to Paris, her associations with the Neckers became
fairly intimate. She was presented to ‘all the
<i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>,’ and was even taken to see Madame
Geoffrin, whose glory now was waning. On the sixth
of July 1776, she met Madame du Deffand at dinner,
and found her gay and lively. Madame du Deffand’s
comments on the bluestocking, in her letters to Walpole,
are singularly indulgent, until corrected by Walpole.
She is polite, thinks Madame du Deffand, but
not over pedantic,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and ‘ennuyeuse, sans doute, mais
bonne femme.’ Mrs. Montagu hired a house at Chaillot,
where she gave suppers for Madame du Deffand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the rest. That she flattered them all, after the most
approved Parisian fashion, no one who has read her
letter to Madame du Deffand can doubt. It is one of
the most skilful pieces of compliment which she ever
devised, and was sent with a gift of two beautiful scent-boxes.
Witness the following extract, and let the
reader remember that Madame du Deffand was blind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p lang="fr">Il ne me reste qu’une ressource; c’est de vous adresser
comme à une divinité et vous offrir simplement de
l’encens; c’est le culte le plus pur et le moins téméraire.
Je vous prie, madame, de me permettre de vous offrir
deux cassolettes, où j’ai mis des aromatiques.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In spite of the success of her Parisian visit, it may
be questioned whether Mrs. Montagu was wholly
satisfied with the spirit of the salons she visited. She
had gone to Paris with the avowed intention of searching,
among the provincial nobility, for ‘some who are
more in the <i lang="fr">ton</i> of Louis XIV’s court’<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> than the ladies
of Versailles. It was, as one might have suspected,
the Rambouillet tradition that attracted her, rather
than the later salon with its freer thought and freer
manners, and its constant change of favourites. She
should have gone to Paris at least as early as the days
of Madame de Lambert.</p>

<p>But it is certain that Mrs. Montagu never succeeded
in attaining to the ease of the Parisian salon. Friends
feared that she would come back more artificial than
ever. Mrs. Boscawen wished that she might get by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
heart Mrs. Chapone’s chapter on Simplicity.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> But
there was no such thing as simplicity in Mrs. Montagu’s
nature: all her instincts were for the elaborate, her
methods in all things complicated, her manner grand,
not easy. Her assemblies became even larger and more
overpowering; the number of ‘the Great’ grew constantly
larger.</p>

<p>Her salon was inevitably the reflection of her own
character. She could be, as Mrs. Thrale witnessed,
‘brilliant in diamonds, solid in judgment, critical in
talk’;<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> she could be, as Johnson freely admitted,
‘par pluribus ... variety in one.’<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> But there was
a certain stiffness in her character that inevitably
communicated itself to her assemblies. Mrs. Chapone,
who had every reason to love her, wrote to Pepys that
he would always find in her good nature, ‘though not
accompanied with remarkable softness.’<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Fanny Burney
was from the first rather overwhelmed by her grand
manner, and Mrs. Delany found at one of her assemblies
‘a formal, formidable circle,’ where she had only
‘a <em>whisper</em> with Mrs. Boscawen, another with Lady
Bute, and a <em>wink</em> from the Duchess of Portland—<em>poor
diet</em> for one who loves a plentiful meal of social friendship.’<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
Six years later she was so dazzled by the
brilliancy of one of Mrs. Montagu’s assemblies that
she fled incontinently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Lady Louisa Stuart, who evidently did not like Mrs.
Montagu, calls attention to another defect. ‘There
was a deplorable lack ... of that art of kneading the
mass well together, which I have known possessed by
women far her inferiors. As her company came in, a
heterogeneous medley, so they went out, each individual
feeling himself single, isolated, and (to borrow a
French phrase) embarrassed with his own person;
which might be partly owing to the awkward position
of the furniture, the mal-arrangement of tables and
chairs. Everything in that house, as if under a spell,
was sure to form itself into a circle or semicircle.’<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
But all this is as nothing compared with the testimony
of Lord Lyttelton. Mrs. Montagu was destined to
receive the unkindest thrust from her own familiar
friend. At some time in the decade of the sixties,
Lord Lyttelton wrote an elaborate letter to a friend
in criticism of the modern wits, whom he proclaimed
‘not worth a beadsman’s rosary.’ The following
passage<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> can refer only to Mrs. Montagu:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No one can take more pains than Mrs. M—— to be
surrounded with men of wit; she bribes, she pensions,
she flatters, gives excellent dinners, is herself a very
sensible woman, and of very pleasing manners; not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
young, indeed, but that is out of the question;—and,
in spite of all these encouragements, which, one would
think, might make wits spring out of the ground, the
conversations of her house are too often critical and
pedantic,—something between the dullness and the
pertness of learning. They are perfectly chaste, and
generally instructive; but a cool and quiet observer
would sometimes laugh to see how difficult a matter
it is for <i lang="fr">la belle Présidente</i> to give colour and life to her
literary circles.</p>
</div>

<p>There was, moreover, evidently much of the <i lang="fr">femme
savante</i> about Mrs. Montagu. Walpole described her
in his most merciless manner as a ‘piece of learned nonsense’;
she and her friends, he continues, ‘vie with one
another till they are as unintelligible as the good folks
at Babel.’<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> This of course is not fair. When was
Walpole ever fair? But it certainly may be taken
as evidence that Mrs. Montagu did not hesitate to
make a display of her knowledge. She had mastered
the art, no doubt, of wearing her learning gracefully,
but never that of gracefully dispensing with it. It
cumbers her correspondence. With Garrick she must
discuss Plautus, Terence, and Molière, with Elizabeth
Carter the <cite>Ethics</cite> of Aristotle, with Beattie the Greek
dramatists, Ossian, Homer, and the ‘wilder Oriental
poets.’ But the reader has throughout the feeling
that the writer is making the best of resources that
are somewhat limited and undisciplined. Her knowledge
of the classics was at best amateurish.</p>

<p>But this deficiency—if such it be—was not fatal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
The learning of a professional scholar is by no means
essential in the mistress of a salon. It may, indeed,
as I have already shown, prove a serious obstacle to her
success; for the means by which she diffuses her influence
are of a totally different sort. With more
essential things, high social rank, a large fortune, wit,
interest in the course of literature, and a faith in her
own power to influence it for good, Mrs. Montagu was
richly endowed. Without her there would have been
no London salons; for all existed in more or less
conscious imitation of hers. She alone succeeded in
becoming a patron of letters. To say that she did not
equal the great Frenchwomen in this art is merely to
say that she was not a genius. She had the power of
attracting people of real importance to her drawing-room,
and even those who ridiculed her social methods
were obliged to admit that they produced an effect.
That effect it is difficult to estimate with precision; for
it is by no means identical with that which she produced
by her own writings or even by her patronage
of writers. She has the honour of having assisted in
spreading the esteem in which literature and men of
letters were held at the close of the century, as opposed
to the anomaly of their position fifty years earlier.
Her achievement is not the less real because it cannot
be exactly calculated.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A far more lovable figure than Mrs. Montagu is
her friendly rival, Elizabeth Vesey. Though the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
daughter of a bishop, the wife of a Member of Parliament,
and mistress of as popular a drawing-room as
could be found in London, she was as free from vanity
as from pretensions to literary gifts. She never
dreamed of shining as a critical essayist; she scribbled
no verses. She was a withered old lady with the heart
of a child, who amused everybody by her enthusiasm
and her naïve manners, which were always a bit slipshod.
She was so notoriously informal that her guests
forgot their elegant reserve, and became, like her,
good-humoured and lively. She moves about her
crowded assemblies like a fairy crone, her parchment
skin seamed and shrivelled with age, her ear-trumpet
dangling from her neck, while she distributes her
promiscuous company, pats her guests on the arm,
breaks up their cliques, and squares the social circle.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
She touched every one into good spirits with what
Elizabeth Carter called the wave of her fairy wand.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Everybody adored her, men and women alike. To
Martin Sherlock<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> she was ‘good Mrs. Vesey—indeed
she is <em>all</em> goodness’; and Horace Walpole bursts into
momentary enthusiasm,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> ‘What English heart ever
excelled hers?’</p>

<p>If she found favour in the eyes of all London, it
was not by any charms of person, for at the time of
her great fame, she had long since lost every trace of
beauty. In 1779, when Miss Burney first met her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
she was a very pattern of old age, with ‘the most
wrinkled, sallow, time-beaten face’ ever seen.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But
her vivid imagination never deserted her, and to the
sophisticated people by whom she was surrounded she
seemed a sort of ethereal meddler in human affairs.
Her friends called her the Sylph.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Mrs. Carter could
detect nothing mortal in her save a love of London,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
and felt about her a suspicion of ‘coral groves and
submarine palaces.’<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> If she was ordered to take
fresh-water baths, she must, like a child, make a game
of it all, play at being primitive, and rear in imagination
an ‘American hut’ on the banks of the Liffey.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
She flitted eagerly about England and Ireland, anxious
to know everybody and see everything.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Mrs. Carter
found her like Bartholomew Cokes, who wanted every
plaything in the Fair.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Indeed, the world must have
seemed to Mrs. Vesey a vast toyshop with endless
opportunities for play, for she could amuse herself by
planning a <i lang="fr">fête champêtre</i>,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> or by inventing a new teapot,
lacking, to be sure, both spout and handle, but of
‘a beautiful Etruscan form.’<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Her guests never knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
what to expect, for she might present them with an
atheist philosopher hot from the salons of Paris or set
them to cutting out Indian figures and flowers, to
paste on her dressing-room windows in imitation of
painted glass.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Dowagers marvel at her, and lament
that oddities are become the fashion.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Her parties were informal to the point of becoming
promiscuous. Her first aim was to get together
every one of importance,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> literary, political, social, and
ecclesiastical, to keep them broken up into small
groups, and to insist on uniting those of different tastes
and mood. She got Walpole side by side with Fanny
Burney<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> (whom he liked at once), and again side by
side with Sir William Jones (whom he did not).<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> She
tried to present Dr. Johnson to the Abbé Raynal, and
drew from the Great Moralist an immortal refusal.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
She was apparently even ambitious to marry Elizabeth
Carter to Thomas Gray.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Yet withal she had the
rare gift of self-obliteration.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> She gave herself no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
airs. She was by nature absent-minded, and she
affected to be more <i lang="fr">distraite</i> than she actually was.
When excitedly denouncing second marriages she
could quite overlook (or <em>seem</em> to overlook) the fact that
she herself had been married twice. ‘Bless me, my
dear! I had quite forgotten it.’ Such wit was but
ill-understood in salons which had never before witnessed
the spectacle of a bluestocking laughing at
herself. There is an Irish whimsicality about her
remarks. When ill, she could declare that her only
happy moment in fourteen days was in a fainting fit,
or again that she was in dread of losing seven or eight
of her senses.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> ‘It’s a very disagreeable thing, I
think,’ said she to Mr. Cambridge, ‘when one has just
made an acquaintance with anybody, and likes them,
to have them die,’<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> a sentiment that set Fanny Burney
to ‘grinning irresistibly,’ and filliping the macaroon
crumbs from her muff to hide her embarrassment.
Mrs. Vesey somehow contrived to make even her deafness
a source of amusement. When Lady Spencer
brought her some silver ears to use instead of trumpets,
she promptly tried them on before her guests, and
greeted George Cambridge with one of them still
clinging to her ear, but as she was moving away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
him spilled it unaware. Surely this bluestocking is a
very human sort.</p>

<p>Those who smiled at her naïveté forgot that it
was a quality very near to wisdom. Her conversation,
and perhaps her letters,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> revealed that instinctive
knowledge of the human heart which is the peculiar
possession of extreme innocence. ‘Few people,’ she
said to Mrs. Carter,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> who quotes her words with
approval—the <em>imprimatur</em> of common sense—‘give
themselves time to be friends’; and as if she only half
understood the century into which she had been born,
inquired ‘why the head is always so suspicious of the
heart.’<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The wise Carter, whose knowledge was so
much more sophisticated, can but honour her for having
the simplicity of a little child, though she would
like to whip her for having its imprudence.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> But it
was this very simplicity of soul that enabled the good
creature to ‘accommodate herself so fully to the awkward
customs and manners of mere actually existing
men and women.’ Mrs. Carter finds it ‘very surprising,’<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
as does the student, and as did Montagu and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
all the dowagers, no doubt; but Miss Burney, with
her keen observation, saw at once that her skill in
selecting guests and her ‘address in rendering them
easy with one another’ was an art that implied ‘no
mean understanding.’<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> She had sufficient skill to
persuade Horace Walpole, who professed to hate her
‘Babels,’ to come and join the Cophthi,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and not to
snub them one and all; she had the skill to keep always
on good terms with Mrs. Montagu; she could
attract the whole Literary Club on alternate Tuesdays,
and filled her drawing-room with the most difficult
people in England to manage.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Yet her methods were
always of the simplest, her collations modest though
delicate, and her house, though interesting because
of its oddity, was hardly an attraction apart from its
mistress.</p>

<p>With all the new emotions of sentimentalism and
romanticism, Mrs. Vesey was in full sympathy, and
she must have done something to popularize these
movements among the <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> of London. She
adored the <cite>Sentimental Journey</cite>. She and Mrs. Carter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
write each other of the solemn awe of storms at sea, of
‘sublime and terrible’ Welsh ‘prospects,’<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> of dim-lit
Gothic cloisters, and the sad note of the owl at set of
sun. She loved the poetry of Gray, and even tempted
the shy poet into her drawing-room.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> She was obliged
to pass much of her time in Ireland, and on her journeys
there and back improved the opportunity of studying
the wild scenery of Wales. She writes to Mrs. Carter
of her journey through Anglesey and over Penmuenmaur.
The story thrilled Mrs. Carter, for she wrote
of it to Mrs. Montagu:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the midst of her passage through these wild
regions, she and Mrs. Hancock<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> were overtaken by a
tempest which greatly heightened the sublime and
terrible of the scene; and you may guess what a description
such an adventure would furnish to an imagination
like hers.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Vesey, moreover, appears to have been alone
among the blues in aspiring to the easier standards of
French manners and to the new ‘freedom of thought,’
though she never really abandoned herself to them.
She was one of the ladies who lent diversity to the
amatory career of Laurence Sterne; but the flirtation,
though feverish enough for a time, either escaped the
notice of Mrs. Vesey’s precise friends or was, by general
consent, hushed up; for it expired at last quite harmlessly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
and left only a handful of letters as proof of its
former vitality. Yorick and this earlier ‘Eliza’ met,
it would appear, in 1762, when Sterne was at the height
of his fame, and enjoying the pleasures of metropolitan
life for a season. He heard Mrs. Vesey sing; walked
twenty paces beside her; felt the ‘harmonic vibrations’
of a heart truly sentimental, and had no sooner left
her than he opened an amatory correspondence with
her. He would give one of his cassocks to explain
the magic of her personality: ‘I believe in my conscience,
dear lady, if truth was known, <em>that you have no
inside at all</em>. That you are graceful, elegant, and
desirable, etc., etc.—every common beholder who can
stare at you, as a Dutch boor does to the Queen of
Sheba,—can easily find out—but that you are sensible,
gentle, and tender and from one end to the other
of you full of the sweetest tones and modulations require
a deeper research—You are a system of harmonic
vibrations—the softest and best attuned of all
instruments.—Lord! I would give away my other
cassock to touch you.’<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Tristram Shandy protests
that his head is turned.</p>

<p>We may follow them to Ranelagh, where they saunter
lackadaisically, indifferent to the crowd and the fireworks,
Mrs. Vesey uttering ‘gentle, amiable, elegant
sentiments in a tone of voice that was originally intended
for a Cherub.’ But the exposure was apparently
too much for the tender frame of Yorick. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
listening to Mrs. Vesey’s voice, he lost his own, and
now ‘colds, coughs, and catarrhs’ have so tied up his
tongue that he can no longer whisper loud enough to
explain Vesey’s effect upon his heart. How often
thereafter he was able to becassock himself and sit in
the warm blue drawing-room listening to the music,
we do not know. The romance did not last long,
certainly; and we hear nothing more of it after the
autumn of 1767, when Mrs. Vesey invited Sterne to
visit her in Ireland, an invitation which his illness
compelled him to decline.</p>

<p>Like the French ladies described by Sterne in the
<cite>Sentimental Journey</cite>, Mrs. Vesey turned, at a certain
age, to agnosticism. Mrs. Montagu had defied Voltaire,
but Mrs. Vesey courted the Abbé Raynal. He
responded with great vivacity and was often in her
drawing-room during the year 1777. Mrs. Boscawen
asserts<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> that she once heard him talk for eight hours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
‘successfully’ and without interruption: ‘One must
have <em>heard and seen it to believe it</em>;’ and Mrs. Chapone
asserts that he talked steadily <em>from one at noon till one</em>
in the morning.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> This particular conversation, however,
did not occur at Mrs. Vesey’s. She would never
have permitted any one thus to turn conversation into
a lecture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vesey’s interest in French agnosticism caused
her friends grave concern. Twice Mrs. Carter denounced
Voltaire when Mrs. Vesey demanded a pronouncement
on his works, and at last wrote that she
would as soon think of playing with toads and vipers,
as of reading such blasphemy and impiety.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> She
argued for the validity of revealed religion, but without
great effect, for Mrs. Vesey continued to play with
fire. She produced strange romantic thrills in herself
by reading the Abbé Raynal during a violent thunderstorm.
Byron, surely, could have understood this, but
it was beyond the blues. ‘’Tis a dangerous amusement
to a mind like yours, indeed to any mind,’ wrote Mrs.
Carter. But dangerous or not, it illustrates the curiosity
of Mrs. Vesey’s mind, and might furnish a historian
of the Romantic Movement with an apt anecdote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>Because of the unpretentiousness of her character,
Mrs. Vesey has always been ranked far below Mrs.
Montagu, but it may be doubted whether the estimate
is quite fair. There were many who found her assemblies
more agreeable<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> than Mrs. Montagu’s more pretentious
parties, especially after that lady’s removal to
Portman Square. Unlike Mrs. Montagu, she made no
attempt to produce literature herself (and for this
posterity should be grateful); but she appears to have
had an instinctive appreciation, not surpassed by the
other, of the true function of the salon. For it was
the office of the bluestockings neither to reform the
whole of London society by giving it a literary tone,
nor to bring into existence a new school of authors
dominated by their ideals; but rather to keep in
motion, by means of social intercourse, the currents of
thought, literary and philosophical. A true <i lang="it">conversazione</i>
can create and vitalize a train of ideas, and Mrs.
Vesey, with her broad and genial interests, was able to
assemble the best representatives of the new ideas, and
bring them into contact with society. This, if there
be any, is the true office of the bluestocking, an office
which Mrs. Vesey discharged with skill and with charm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About Mrs. Montagu and Mrs. Vesey there revolved
other luminaries. Certain of them—Elizabeth Carter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Hester Chapone, Hannah More, and Fanny Burney—though
they presided over no salon, achieved an independent
reputation as authors, and will therefore be
considered in later chapters. Others of them—as
Miss Monckton (still remembered for Reynolds’s
sentimental portrait of her), Lady Lucan, Lady Herries,
Mrs. Greville, the admirable Mrs. Cholmondeley
(niece of Walpole and friend of Miss Burney), and the
sensible Mrs. Walsingham—have left, in general,
little more than a name (and an adjective) to posterity.
Others, who are more often encountered, demand a
brief consideration.</p>

<p>There is, for example, the gracious figure of Mrs.
Boscawen,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> wife of the Admiral, and one of the best-loved
women in London. Boswell’s compliment to
her will be familiar to students of the <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>:
‘If it be not presumptuous in me to praise her, I would
say that her manners are the most agreeable and her
conversation the best of any lady with whom I ever
had the happiness to be acquainted.’<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Miss More described
her parties in the words of Madame de Sévigné
as ‘all daffodil, all rose, all jonquil,’ and dwelt on her
power to make each of her guests feel that he had
been <ins class="corr" id="tn-153" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the inmediate object'">
the immediate object</ins> of her attention.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Her reputation was thus always rather social than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
literary.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Her letters, indeed, were highly regarded
by her friends, and were sometimes preferred to Mrs.
Montagu’s—a preference by no means audacious.
The repeated comparison with Madame de Sévigné is
certainly less happy. Mrs. Boscawen’s letters, as preserved
in Mrs. Delany’s <cite>Autobiography</cite> and the <cite>Memoirs
of Hannah More</cite>, have the affectionate intimacy
but not the kindling wit and sprightliness which distinguish
familiar correspondence at its best. It is
sufficient to say of these letters that they have successfully
preserved Mrs. Boscawen’s pleasant personality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boscawen emulated Mrs. Montagu as a patron
of rising young authors by entering into warm personal
relations with Hannah More. They first became intimate
when, on the twelfth night of <cite>Percy</cite>, Mrs. Boscawen
sent the successful dramatist a wreath of myrtle,
laurel, and bay. This stimulated the young lady to
an exhibition of that flattery for which she was already
famous. In an <cite>Ode to the Hon. Mrs. Boscawen</cite>, Apollo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
himself is made to rebuke Hannah for wearing these
floral honours, asserting that it is for Mrs. Boscawen
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent6">the faithful <em>myrtle blooms</em>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For her the sage’s bay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And even thou shalt claim a name</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And challenge some renown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boscawen’s friendship is thy fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her praise thy <span class="smcap">Laurel Crown</span>.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the two ladies had only begun their career of compliment.
Somewhat later Miss More sent to her patron
a bottle of ‘otto of roses,’ having learned that that
lady’s organs ‘partake the refinement that graces her
mind.’ This is not the first instance we have encountered
of the use of incense in the bluestocking ritual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boscawen sometimes varied her flowery wreaths
of praise with gifts and practical suggestions. When
she learns that Miss More has been reading Homer and
Tasso, she at once becomes ambitious for an English
epic from the pen of a woman. ‘Some spark,’ she
thinks, from these older geniuses, ‘will communicate
to that train of poetic fire, <i lang="fr">qui vous appartient</i>, and the
explosion will ascend in many a brilliant star.’<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The
honourable lady demands and obtains an <cite>Ode on the
Marquess of Worcester’s Birthday</cite>, into which the author
had the sense to weave a compliment to Mrs. Boscawen
and to ‘Glanvilla,’ her estate.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Meanwhile the patron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
is weeping her eyes red over <cite>Percy</cite>, circulating copies
of Miss More’s <cite>Essays</cite>, eliciting praises from friends
and <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>—all duly forwarded—and rebuking,
very gently, the rising authoress for not proclaiming
more loudly the greatness of the sex: ‘where shall
we find a champion if you (armed at all points) desert
us?’<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Miss More’s chief tribute to Mrs. Boscawen, however,
was her poem, <cite>Sensibility</cite>, published in 1782, in the
form of an epistle to that lady. In rapturous verse
Sensibility is hailed as the parent of charity, charm, and
many other bluestocking virtues; but, above all, ’tis
this that ‘gives Boscawen half her power to please.’
As the poem furnishes the most convenient statement
of Mrs. Boscawen’s connection with the group of ladies
we are studying, a rather long extract from it must be
given:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Somewhat too much of this.</p>

<p>The story continues in the same strain till long after
the publication of Miss More’s <cite>Florio</cite> in 1786. It is
only necessary to add that it is to Mrs. Boscawen that
we owe the painting of Opie’s delightful portrait of Miss
More.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> It does more to perpetuate the charm of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
bluestocking ladies than all their congratulatory epistles—in
prose or verse.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Ord<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> has by modern writers frequently been
associated with Mrs. Montagu and Mrs. Vesey as
originating the bluestocking <i lang="it">conversazioni</i>.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Just why
Mrs. Ord should have been chosen to complete the triad
of ladies it is difficult to say. She is not mentioned in
Miss More’s <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite>, in Dr. Burney’s verses, or in
Boswell’s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>. Her name occurs but once,
and quite casually, in Walpole’s <cite>Letters</cite>; and Johnson
writes but once<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> of having been present at her assembly.
Even those who describe her parties speak rather of her
guests than of herself, and praise her good nature without
mentioning her conversation.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Her talk was, it
appears, considered heavy, so that Miss Burney herself
was obliged to admit that it lacked both mirth and
instruction, and that she loved Mrs. Ord for her friendliness
but not for her brilliancy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mrs. Ord was one who early made the
experiment of banishing cards and dancing from her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
evening parties and substituting undisturbed conversation
as the staple of her entertainment. Like Mrs.
Vesey she abhorred formality, and made her guests
draw their chairs about a large table in the middle of
the room, remarking—and it is one of the few remarks
of hers that has been preserved—that a table was the
‘best friend to sociable conversation.’<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Here, apparently,
she succeeded in getting the unity without the
hard formality of the dreaded circle.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>She had, moreover, a skill in the choice of her guests
which usually saved her from the charge of assembling
crowds indiscriminately.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Pepys and Dr. Burney unite
in praising her ability to mix her ingredients, and for
this the latter pronounces her an excellent cook. Miss
More liked her assemblies because there she could have
Sir Joshua and Mr. Cambridge all to herself<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> or discuss
the relative merits of Pope and Dryden, sitting apart
with Mrs. Montagu and Horace Walpole.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Ord wished to take the place of Mrs.
Thrale as the social patron of Fanny Burney. She it
was who conducted Fanny to her royal prison at
Windsor,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> who helped to keep her in touch with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
old friends,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> who showered gifts upon her and carried
her to oratorios, and who, when the young woman was
worn out by her servitude, put the map of England into
the hands of ‘her child,’ and bade her choose the
journey she would take. This trip, which was through
south-west England, lasted many weeks, and it was
mid-September before the two finally drove out of
Bath towards London in Mrs. Ord’s coach-and-four.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
Nor did the services of this ‘excellent and maternal’
creature stop with this, for the very next year she
carried Miss Burney to the ‘salubrious hills of Norbury,’
and there administered what the Diarist, in a flight of
rhetoric worthy of her latest years, called ‘the balsamic
medicine of social tenderness.’<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> But nothing came of
this patronage in the way of literature, so that Mrs.
Ord’s kindness, though challenging our admiration,
adds little to the movement we are tracing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Another woman closely associated with Miss Burney,
and one who profoundly influenced her life, was that
venerable relic of the former age, Mary Granville<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Delany, whom Burke called ‘not only the woman of
fashion of the present age, but ... the highest bred
woman in the world.’<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> ‘Swift’s Mrs. Delany,’ they
loved to call her, for she had known the great Dean
in his latter days. Of the relationship, such as it was,
she never tired of talking, and in this she was wise, for it
was her chief claim to distinction in literary circles.
The woman who could display a sheaf of private letters
from Swift and to whom the <cite>Spectator</cite> was ‘almost
too modern to speak of’<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> was of course worshipped
by every bluestocking in London; but she was never
quite a blue herself. She did not wish to be. Miss
More, it is true, claims her as one of the circle in her
poem <cite>Sensibility</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Delany</span> too is ours; serenely bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisdom’s strong ray, and virtue’s milder light:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she who blessed the friend and graced the lays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of poignant Swift, still gilds my social days;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long, long protract thy light, O star benign!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose setting beams with milder lustre shine.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Mrs. Delany seldom allowed her lustre to shine
upon the salon, and was anything but mild in her
opinion of Mrs. Montagu’s assemblies. She was more
interested in the Royal Family than in the progress of
literature, and despite her early associations, preferred
the society of rank to that of genius. She was graciously
pleased when Garrick received her friend the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Duchess of Portland and herself ‘<em>very respectfully</em>,’
and showed himself ‘sensible of the honour’ done
him.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> She was vexed that Mason’s tepid tragedy,
<cite>Elfrida</cite>, should be ‘prostituted’ by a public performance,
and ‘the charms of virgins represented by the abandoned
nymphs of Drury Lane.’ ‘Such a poem,’ she
continues, ‘would have been represented in days of
yore by the youthful part of the Royal family or those
of the first rank. Indeed, in <em>these</em> our days (<em>save our
own Royal Family</em>), it would be difficult to find representatives
suited to such virtuous and refined characters.’<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
Such a person, who was for ever protesting
that she was in love with the King, the Queen, and the
whole Royal Family,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> was in no position to mediate
properly between authors and ‘the Great.’ Her one
conception of serving them was to render them up, a
living sacrifice, to the Royal Family, as Miss Burney
(who was dazzled by the friend of Swift and the friend
of the Queen) discovered to her cost. When Miss
Burney hesitated to enter upon her service as Dresser
to Queen Charlotte—a post which her intimacy with
Mrs. Delany had brought her—it was Mrs. Delany
who was ‘much mortified’ that so flattering a proposal
could cause a moment’s hesitation.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Delany is a significant figure in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the salon by virtue of the fascination which she exercised
through her quondam connection with a great
man; but of genuine interest in the salon she had
little, and of influence upon the course of literature
none at all.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Alone among the literary ladies of the age, Mrs.
Thrale has retained the fascination which she exercised
in her own time. The fame of the other bluestockings
has gone from less to less; but hers has remained
constant, if indeed it has not increased. This is of
significance, for it shows either that she was more
modern than her sisters or more universal. She might
consistently have aspired to the title, ‘Queen of the
Bluestockings,’ but she did not even care whether she
was reckoned one of them, contenting herself with
outwitting them at every point. It was she, for example,
who captured the two authors most coveted by the
mistresses of the salons, Johnson and Miss Burney, and
‘planted’ them in her house.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Her friendship with
the former, though it cannot be shown to have altered
the course of his works, gave birth to an admirable
series of familiar letters, which Hannah More found
‘true letters of friendship which are meant to show
kindness rather than wit.’<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But more important than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
such published results was the fame which Johnson
lent to Mrs. Thrale by his residence at her home.
The nearest approach to the true salon that we find in
the eighteenth century in England is the dining-room
at Streatham; the spectacle of Johnson there reading
aloud from the proof-sheets of the <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite> is in
exact accord with the best French traditions of the salon.</p>

<p>In many other respects Mrs. Thrale showed that she
was capable of fulfilling the more important functions
of a literary hostess. It was she who attempted to
direct the genius of Fanny Burney towards the theatre,
prevailing upon her to write a comedy. It is true that
the resulting play, <cite>The Witlings</cite>, was not thought by
Dr. Burney a fit successor to <cite>Evelina</cite>, and was accordingly
destroyed; but in the absence of any proof to
the contrary and in view of the influence which Mrs.
Thrale could bring to bear in the theatrical world
through Murphy and others, it is difficult to see why
her advice to the young writer was not sound. Sheridan,
than whom there was no better judge, gave similar
counsel.</p>

<p>Finally, when, after her marriage and departure from
England, as Mrs. Piozzi, she printed her <cite>Anecdotes of the
Late Samuel Johnson</cite>, the value of what she had to tell
and her vivacity in telling it enabled her to triumph over
a slipshod style and an inaccurate method, and to
establish, once for all, her reputation in the literary
world, a reputation which the bluestockings were
foolish enough to think she had lost for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>There is no need here to discuss the anomalies of
Mrs. Thrale’s character. They have been dwelt on
unnecessarily and fruitlessly. She had no illusions
about her friends, and least of all about her own importance.
She looked out on the world in which she
moved, shrewdly and, on the whole, sanely. She knew
how to make people happy and how to put the Great
at their ease. ‘Mrs. Thrale,’ says Mr. Seccombe,
‘moved among them serene, lively, “a pretty woman
still,” an exorciser of melancholy, the cheeriest of
hostesses, quite unconscious of erudition, gaily spontaneous,
the queen of Streatham. Her wayward
naturalness made her seem a rose among hot-house
flowers. Her innate brightness enabled her, as has
been said, to romp with learning and to play blind man’s
buff with the sages.’ In the somewhat stifling atmosphere
of salons such a personality is of the very highest
worth.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="smcap">Bluestockings as Authors</span></h3>

<p>Much mischief to the cause of criticism is wrought
by the specialists. Investigators in the underworld of
forgotten books, to which scholarly competition too
frequently drives them, often become so accustomed to
the darkness about them that they mistake a glimmer
for the glorious light of the upper world, and hasten to
inform an inattentive public that the dim by-ways and
dark corners of the realm of dead authors are by no
means lacking in brilliancy. But such assertions serve
rather to darken counsel than to illuminate the world.
Enthusiasm for a subject sometimes coexists with a
state of delusion about it. It ought to be possible to
discover that a forgotten book is readable without trying
to convince the public that an acquaintance with
it is indispensable to all who pretend to culture.</p>

<p>The works of the bluestockings have all long since
sunk into this oblivion. The benevolent reader of
them has the feeling which Dante experienced so
strongly when he met in hell the souls who had once
been famous in a brighter world. These books seem
to appeal to the reader to reëstablish something of their
former fame, even though this, in its turn, prove to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
but transitory. Who now reads Montagu? To many
the question itself will be unintelligible; or will be
taken to refer to another; yet in 1770 all the world
was reading her. It is hardly too much to say that as a
critic she was esteemed almost as highly as Johnson
himself. She was known as the woman who had dared
to challenge comparison with Lucian, as the defender
and even as the ‘patroness’ of Shakespeare; she was
an Eve in the world of critics, an armed Athena who
had set her foot on the head of the serpent Voltaire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s career as a writer began with the
composition of three dialogues which were added to
Lord Lyttelton’s <cite>Dialogues of the Dead</cite> when they
appeared in 1760. The works were anonymous; but
the news that they were by Mrs. Montagu was soon
spread abroad. Many had no doubt inferred her
authorship already from the enthusiastic words in
which the noble lord spoke of her: ‘I shall think,’ he
says, ‘the Public owes me a great Obligation for having
excited a Genius so capable of uniting Delight with
Instruction, and giving to Knowledge and Virtue those
Graces which the Wit of the Age has too often employed
all its skill to bestow upon Folly and Vice.’ The public
did not disappoint the peer. Five editions were called
for before 1768.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s dialogues might easily be dismissed
by saying that they do not reach the level of Lyttelton’s.
But if it be required to detect grades of value in work
so uniformly flat, we may say that the dialogue between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Mercury and a Modern Fine Lady is the best, as that
between Hercules and Cadmus is the worst. They
are all well called Dialogues of the Dead, for despite
all their inflation, they never once betray any semblance
of vitality. Of characterization they are wholly
innocent, but not of profundity. Cadmus, for example,
gives utterance to this: ‘The genuine glory, the
proper distinction of the rational Species, arises from
the perfection of the mental powers. Courage is apt
to be fierce, and Strength is often exerted in acts of
Oppression. But Wisdom is the Associate of Justice;
It assists her to form equal Laws, to pursue right
measures, to correct power, protect weakness, and to
unite individuals in a common Interest and general
Welfare.’ It is amazing the amount of such platitudinizing
which the eighteenth century consumed with
relish. It is one of the marvels of that marvellous era.
The style derived its popularity in part from Johnson,
who himself achieved a bare victory over its deadliness
by the vivacity of his intellect.</p>

<p>In the dialogue between Mercury and Mrs. Modish,
the author was at once less pretentious and in closer
touch with her subject. Yet even here her desire to
give instruction triumphs over any temptation to
depict human nature. Mrs. Modish, the frivolous
butterfly, explains the phrase <i lang="fr">bon ton</i> quite as seriously
as Mrs. Carter the bluestocking would have done:
‘It is—I can never tell you what it is; but I will try
to tell you what it is not. In conversation it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Wit; in manners it is not Politeness; in behaviour it is
not Address; but it is a little like them all. It can
only belong to people of a certain rank, who live in a
certain manner, with certain persons who have not
certain virtues and who have certain Vices, and who
inhabit a certain Part of the Town.’ This is perhaps
the best thing in the dialogues. One great advantage
of these works remains to be mentioned. They triumph
over the form in which they are written, for they
never once remind us of Lucian.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Montagu had yet to achieve her unique
distinction. It was nine years later that she delighted
the world by appearing as the champion of Shakespeare,
redressing his wrongs,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> and vindicating him
from the charges of Voltaire. She published a work
somewhat largely entitled, <cite>An Essay on the Writings
and <ins class="corr" id="tn-169" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Genius of Shakespear'">
Genius of Shakespeare</ins>, Compared with the Greek and
French Dramatic Poets, with some Remarks upon the
Misrepresentations of Mons. de Voltaire</cite>. The attacks
upon Shakespeare which Mrs. Montagu felt it incumbent
upon herself to answer need no discussion here;<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
it may suffice to say that her defence was more widely
read in England than the ‘misrepresentations’ which
called it into being. It was regarded as a standard
piece of criticism, and its fame penetrated to France
and even to Italy.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> It is impossible to give adequate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
illustrations of the esteem in which the book was held.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
It conferred upon Mrs. Montagu the reputation of a
critic, and gave her an enviable position among English
writers for the space of thirty years. In the chorus
of praise with which this feeble book was greeted there
was but one discordant voice. When Reynolds remarked
that Mrs. Montagu’s essay did her honour,
Dr. Johnson retorted: ‘Yes, Sir, it does <em>her</em> honour, but
it would do nobody else honour. I have indeed, not
read it all. But when I take up the end of a web, and
find it packthread, I do not expect by looking further
to find it embroidery. Sir, I will venture to say, there
is not one sentence of true criticism in her book.’<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>It is to this view that posterity—when it has had
any views at all on the subject—has inclined. Professor
Huchon naturally deplores it,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and builds up a
judicious defence of the defence. But the modern
reader will probably agree with Mr. Lounsbury that
‘it is in many ways one of the most exasperating of
books.’ Mrs. Montagu’s ignorance of the Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
era was both profound and extensive. Her
conception of Shakespeare’s environment may be
deduced from the following quotation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The songs sung by our bards at feasts and merry-makings
were of a very coarse kind: as the people were
totally illiterate, and only the better sort could read
even their mother tongue, their taste was formed on
these compositions. As yet our stage had exhibited
only those palpable allegories by which rude unlettered
moralists instruct and please the gross and ignorant
multitude.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A woman who conceived of Shakespeare as living ‘in
the dark shades of Gothic barbarism,’<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and who lamented
his lack of ‘the admonitions of delicate connoisseurs’<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
had in effect yielded all that the most
virulent critic could demand. Mrs. Montagu’s enthusiasms
seem very pallid after her alarming concessions.
She considers Falstaff humorous and Macbeth tragic,
and is, in general and as usual, platitudinous. But
her continuous apologies and concessions really form
the staple of her work. ‘She found,’ says Lounsbury,
‘the speech of Brutus to the people in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>,
quaint and affected. She exhibited her utter incapacity
to comprehend the rhetorical skill of Antony by
declaring that the repetition of the epithet “honorable”
in his speech was perhaps too frequent. The character
of Pistol in the second part of <cite>Henry IV</cite> was too much
for her to understand. Following previous critics she
found many bombast speeches in the tragedy of <cite>Macbeth</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Like her predecessors she unfortunately forgot to
particularize them; lapse of time has now made it
difficult to discover them.’</p>

<p>One of the features of Mrs. Montagu’s <cite>Essay</cite> was
a series of comparisons between the Shakespearian
drama and the ancient Greek. Here she was indeed on
dangerous ground, for she could not read the language
of Æschylus. This, however, did not discourage her
from expressing herself very decidedly on the characteristics
of his art. She pronounces the supernatural
element in <cite>The Persians</cite> unfitted to the piece, and finds
‘something of a comic and satirical turn’ in the ghost
of Darius.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> She asserts that the Eumenides of the
Oresteian trilogy ‘seem both acting out of their sphere
and below their character’;<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> but admits that the whole
story ‘might be allegorical.’ Such indeed she considered
very nearly all of Æschylus to be; for she had a
peculiar notion that his materials were derived at
second-hand ‘from the hieroglyphic land of Egypt,’
and, though in the grosser times of Greece literally
understood by the vulgar, were in more philosophic
ages ‘again transmuted into allegory.’<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> But it is idle
longer to stir this forgotten dust.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A woman truly learned in the classics, whose abiding
common sense protected her from the ridicule freely
poured out upon bluestockings, was Miss (or, by
courtesy, Mrs.) Elizabeth Carter, the spinster of Deal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
To Mrs. Montagu (patron of letters) she was an indulgent
preceptress, a very Pierian source of learning, and
much that passed as erudition in the ‘female Mæcenas’
was in reality derived at second-hand from Mrs. Carter.
Mrs. Montagu was never unwilling to sit at the feet of
the woman whose reading ranged from Aristotle to
Petrarch and from Diodorus Siculus to the <cite>Sorrows of
Werther</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> who would correspond with her respecting the
Newtonian mechanics or the Stoic philosophers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter’s reputation was made by a translation
of the extant works of Epictetus, an elegant quarto put
forth in 1758, provided with an introduction and ample
notes. The style of the translation is, in a very high
degree, chaste and pleasing, and nowhere suggests the
line-by-line method of the laborious translator. The
introductory essay is an admirable exposition of the
Stoic philosophy. The following specimen may show
that Mrs. Carter was capable not only of a spirited
style, but <ins class="corr" id="tn-173" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of geniune critical'">
of genuine critical</ins> treatment of her subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About the generality of mankind, the Stoics do not
appear to have given themselves any kind of trouble.
They seemed to consider all (except the few who were
students in the intricacies of a philosophic system) as
very little superior to Beasts: and, with great tranquillity,
left them to follow the devices of their own
ungoverned appetites and passions.</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to the value of the book as a translation
of Epictetus, it is perhaps sufficient to point out that
it was, in its own time, a standard commentary, that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
passed into a second edition in 1759, and that it is
the basis upon which a subsequent translator has been
content to build.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> It has, moreover, renewed its youth
in the recent reprints of popular libraries of the classics.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Carter has, therefore, transferred to modern
times something of her scholarly fame. Yet she was not
a pedant, and never gave herself the airs of a <i lang="fr">femme savante</i>.
Johnson (who wrote a Greek epigram in her honour
that she might be celebrated in ‘as many different
languages as Lewis le Grand’<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>) used to say that she
could ‘make a pudding as well as translate Epictetus
from the Greek, and work a handkerchief as well as
compose a poem.’<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> He paid her the compliment of
receiving two of her essays for the pages of <cite>The Rambler</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
and these, though dull, are not more unreadable
than the rest of that periodical.</p>

<p>Of her collected poems there were four editions
during her own life. But it must be frankly admitted
that her reputation as an independent author, though
respectable in her own day,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> has since suffered total
extinction. Yet the student may discover in her poems
here and there a point of antiquarian interest. For our
purpose the volume is significant as containing lyrics to
Mrs. Vesey and Mrs. Montagu. Both poems, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
addressed to living ladies, contrive to belong to the
Churchyard School and to prolong faint echoes of Gray.
Two of the stanzas addressed to Mrs. Vesey are plainly
intended to counteract that lady’s rationalism, and
may be quoted here as a specimen of Mrs. Carter’s
poetic powers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not for themselves the toiling Artists build;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Not for himself contrives the studious Sage:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To distant Views by mystic Force compelled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All give the <em>present</em> to the <em>future</em> age....</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet check that impious Thought, my gentle Friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which bounds our Prospects by our fleeting Breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which hopeless sees unfinished Life descend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And ever bars the Prison Gates of Death.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Over the whole volume is cast the shadow of the now-fashionable
melancholy, and much is made of the midnight
moon, the evening dew, the ‘Gothic pile,’ and
the ivy bower of the bird of night. These are worth
mention as showing that Mrs. Carter’s interests were
not bounded by the school of Pope. Her tastes, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Mrs. Vesey’s, grew increasingly romantic, and though
she detested <cite>Werther</cite><a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and never doubted that Rousseau
was mad,<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> she was always an affectionate believer in
Ossian.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> She felt the new passion for landscape. In
thought she accompanies Mrs. Vesey to the cliffs of
Snowden,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and regrets that Mrs. Montagu cannot
ascend the heights of windy Morven.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> At Eastry she
dreams herself back to the worship of Woden.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Her
interest in Gothic architecture is intense, and she
writes about the demolition of old buildings like a disciple
of Ruskin: ‘It seems to me that when a fair
inheritance is transmitted to a family they ought to
feel a certain degree of tenderness to the abode of the
ancestors from whom it is derived, which ought at
least to sink quietly by the silent depredations of time,
and not be torn down by the rude hand of human
violence.’<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>This interest in romance enabled her to understand
the Celtic imaginings of Mrs. Vesey as her learning and
her knowledge of philosophy gave her a control over
Mrs. Montagu. Her friendship with the two ladies
was unruffled throughout, and she received an annuity
of £100 from the latter without any sacrifice of dignity.
She never lost her head about anything—least of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
about herself. She was a scholar and had a scholar’s
love of the classics, yet she was broad enough to know
when the age was widening its horizon. In an age of
prudes, she dared to like <cite>Tom Jones</cite>. In an age of
wits, she appreciated wit, yet had the sense to see that
it is a ‘squint of the understanding which is mighty apt
to set things in a wrong place.’<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> She understood and
approved what was best in the salons, but could be
happy without any pretensions to a career in them.</p>

<p>Thus her life was passed serenely without social
rivalries, without the attempt or desire to follow her
ostentatious friends afar, and while escaping the criticism
so freely visited upon them, she had the honour of
contributing by her quiet, serious, and almost unseen influence
to whatever of solid worth they were to achieve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Intimately associated with Miss Carter was ‘the
admirable Mrs. Chapone,’ who, when Miss Mulso, had
been one of Richardson’s ‘Daughters.’ Her two
chief works, <cite>Letters on the Improvement of the Mind</cite> and
<cite>Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</cite>, were the result of
bluestocking patronage, and were dedicated to Mrs.
Montagu and Mrs. Carter respectively. The former,
having seen Mrs. Chapone’s letters to a favourite niece,
recommended their publication, and assisted in preparing
them for the press by correcting them with her
‘elegant pen.’<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The preparation of the second volume
was undertaken at the instigation of Mrs. Carter and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
with the approval of Mrs. Montagu; though Mrs.
Delany claims the honour of having first put the plan
into the author’s head.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Chapone’s <cite>Letters</cite> were supposed to have had
an enormous influence on the conduct of young women.
According to Hannah More, in <cite>Sensibility</cite>, Chapone
‘forms the rising age.’ In Samuel Hoole’s <cite>Aurelia</cite>, the
heroine has a vision of an ideal woman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">On the plain toilet, with no trophies gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Chapone’s</span> instructive volume open lay.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But one is inclined to suspect that this volume belongs
to that large class of admonitory works less popular
with the young than with their parents and preceptors.
The book was put into the hands of every young girl
from the Princess Royal downwards. Mrs. Delany
considered it next to the Bible as an entertaining and
edifying work for youthful females. She advises that
not more than six lines of it be read at one sitting, in
order that it may be the more deeply impressed on the
attention, and thinks that the historical and geographical
parts of it should be got by heart. She hopes
her grand-niece will read it once a year, until she has
a daughter to read it to her.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Mrs. Chapone herself
smiled at the popularity of the book, and considered its
success to be due principally to the patronage of Mrs.
Montagu, and in part to the ‘world’s being so fond of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
being educated.’<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> It is probable that it was generally
used as an antidote to the <cite>Letters</cite> of Chesterfield which
appeared about the same time, and had a very different
reception.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapone’s <cite>Letters</cite> consist almost entirely of
advice; if she ever wanders from this it is to give instruction.
She treats in turn of religion, the Bible, the
affections, the temper, economy, politeness, geography,
and history. It is all admirable, incontrovertible,
wholesome, and heavy. It is like oatmeal—an old-fashioned
food which should be consumed in quantities
by the young, but for which they perversely seem to
have no appetite. It will be remembered that when
Lydia Languish received an untimely visit from Mrs.
Malaprop, she wished to be found reading Mrs. Chapone;
though her interests were more seriously engaged
by works less uplifting. Of literary quality in these
<cite>Letters</cite> one can hardly speak, for it is difficult to diffuse
literary quality through two hundred pages of solid
advice.</p>

<p>The contents of Mrs. Chapone’s second volume are
hardly different. There are essays (‘Affectation and
Simplicity’; ‘Conversation’), but they are in the same
hortatory strain as the <cite>Letters</cite>. There are poems—fortunately
few—several of which are addressed to
Elizabeth Carter. They are, in general, like that lady’s
poems, save that they reveal the influence of Collins
rather than of Gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>The most interesting things Mrs. Chapone wrote
were her familiar letters.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> They contain many interesting
remarks on Richardson, and Johnson, both of
whom were personally known to the author. They
have an independence, an ease, and a vivacity that are
quite lacking in the more solemn productions. The
reader of them may find it in his heart to regret that
Mrs. Chapone was so filled with a sense of the earnestness
of life and of the importance of piety. A long
indulgence in frivolity might have saved her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Hannah More had larger ambitions and more
varied talents than the other bluestocking authors.
She wrote poems lyrical, occasional, and narrative;
she wrote dramas tragic, classical, and sacred; and she
wrote essays and critiques of conduct. In all her
earlier work she was assisted and inspired by the bluestockings.
She was their chosen poet. She represented
them in print as Mrs. Montagu represented them
in the salon. She celebrated them all in verse, and
dedicated in turn to Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Montagu,
and Mrs. Vesey. It is with this earlier period of her
career that we are exclusively concerned; the voluminous
works which the lady produced after her separation
from the bluestockings form no proper part of our
inquiry.</p>

<p>Miss More’s relations with the bluestockings began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
in 1774, soon after her arrival in London. The exact
date of her first visit to the metropolis is uncertain.
Her biographer, Roberts, who seldom gives himself any
concern with dates, says that this took place in ‘1773
or 4’; but inasmuch as Miss More dedicated her
<cite>Inflexible Captive</cite> to Mrs. Boscawen as early as March
1, 1774, the former date would appear the more probable.
Her introduction to the <i lang="it">literati</i> was due to Garrick,
whose interest in Miss More had been roused by her
description of his acting in <cite>Lear</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> By 1775 Hannah
More was a recognized member of the circle that surrounded
Mrs. Montagu. Her poems, <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite> and
<cite>Sensibility</cite>, which have been noticed elsewhere in this
book, were composed directly in their honour; but
works of a more public appeal created no less enthusiasm
among these ladies. Thus her ballad, <cite>Sir Eldred of the
Bower</cite>, which appeared in 1775, was greeted by Mrs.
Montagu in her most extravagant manner. She
admired ‘the spirit and fire of the gothic character’
in the tale; the simplicity of the plot, the depiction of
ancient manners (save the mark!), the primitive sentiments,
and the characterization—all these challenged
the critical approval of Mrs. Montagu. The tale of
<cite>The Bleeding Rock</cite>, in the same volume, she esteemed no
less highly. ‘Your Rock,’ she wrote, ‘will stand unimpaired
by ages as eminent as any in the Grecian Parnassus.’<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Such was the measure of bluestocking praise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
But the poems had a sanction more important than
this. They were read by a larger circle, Reynolds,
Garrick, and Johnson; they became the ‘theme of
conversation in all polite circles.’ Johnson could
repeat all the best stanzas by heart.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> He read both
poems with the author, made some alterations in <cite>Sir
Eldred</cite>, and even—as was his custom with poems submitted
to his judgment—added certain lines to it.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>The poems belong to the Gothic school, and may
well have been suggested by Percy’s <cite lang="fr">Reliques</cite>; Johnson’s
interest in them would be hard to understand
were they not the production of a woman whom he
playfully termed ‘the most powerful versificatrix’
in the language. But the bluestockings loved romance<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
and the primitive world to which they thought it introduced
them. The fact that this world, as conceived
by Hannah More, has no remote similarity to our own
made it only the more conformable to bluestocking
standards of the antique. In reading this lady’s poems
and plays one is constantly reminded of those still-popular
engravings of the eighteenth century, in which
distressed virgins, in carefully studied poses, cast their
melting eyes up to heaven. They live in bowers;
refer to themselves in the third person, as the ‘sad
Elwina’ and ‘the distressed Julia’; and when disappointed
in love, or (to speak in their own idiom) when
their flame is not reciprocated, immediately go mad,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
and after a painful scene before the footlights complete
their career by sudden death. Their lovers are of
sterner stuff. They seek wars in distant climes, disappear
for long periods of time, and are reckoned dead, only
to reappear just as some domestic tragedy is reaching
its climax; they are for ever drawing their swords—frequently
to plunge them into their own bosoms.
Miss More made full use of the poetic license which
governs this pasteboard world. Her characters are
burdened with no human motives, and it is idle to seek
for related cause and effect in their conduct. But
morality flourishes. Thus in <cite>Sir Eldred</cite> we learn the
dangers of jealousy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The deadliest wounds with which we bleed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Our crimes alone inflict;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man’s <em>mercies</em> from God’s hand proceed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His <em>miseries</em> from his <em>own</em>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But as the hero never once in the course of the poem
acted like a human being, the force of the moral is
somewhat impaired.</p>

<p>In 1777 Miss More essayed a higher flight. She
had written dramas in her school-teaching days,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and
now, with the assistance of Garrick, produced a
romantic tragedy, entitled <cite>Percy</cite>. Its title, if not its
contents, indicates the influence of Home’s <cite>Douglas</cite>.
The situation in this play, venerable in romance, deals
with two rival houses, those of Percy and Douglas,
a heroine forced into an unwilling marriage with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
rival of her lover, who has been killed in the Crusades.
The distressed heroine and the returned lover (who
had not really been killed) meet in a garden-bower:<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">
<em>Percy.</em> &#160; &#160; Am I awake? Is that Elwina’s voice?<br>
<em>Elwina.</em> &#160; Percy, thou most adored—and most deceived!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">If ever fortitude sustained thy soul,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">When vulgar minds have sunk beneath the stroke,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Let thy imperial spirit now support thee.—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">If thou canst be so wondrous merciful,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Do not, O do not curse me!—but thou wilt,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thou must—for I have done a dreadful deed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A deed of wild despair, a deed of horror.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I am, I am—</span><br>
<em>Percy.</em>  <span class="pad20pc">Speak, say, what art thou?</span><br>
<em>Elwina.</em> <span class="pad40pc">Married.</span><br>
<em>Percy.</em>  <span class="pad60pc">Oh!</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is unnecessary to follow the course of the tragedy;
for the reader’s own imagination will suggest it.</p>

<p>The play was a success in every way. It ran for
twenty-one nights. No tragedy for years had been so
successful. Mrs. Barry was at her finest in the mad-scene
at the end. The author made nearly six hundred
pounds.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The play was translated into German, and
acted with success in Vienna. The bluestockings
were triumphant. Mrs. Montagu appeared repeatedly
in her box at Covent Garden. Mrs. Boscawen, who could
carry Duchesses to the theatre with her, sent the author<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
a wreath of bay.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Mrs. Delany invited her to dinner.
Garrick, who had written the prologue, introduced
her to Home, thus presenting ‘Percy to the Douglas.’<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>In <cite>Percy</cite> Miss More reached the summit of her early
achievement, and the book is still sought by collectors.
Readers, if in an indulgent mood, will perhaps agree
with Walpole, who found the play better than he expected,
and, though devoid of nature, not lacking in
good situations.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Severer folk will side with Mrs.
Thrale, who considered it foolish, and thought Fanny
Burney ought to be whipped if she did not write a
better.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The truth probably lies between the two
opinions. To the eighteenth century the piece certainly
seemed to have merit. At any rate, it was
popular enough to be revived in order that Mrs.
Siddons might appear as Elwina. Had it survived
to the mid-nineteenth century it might have proved
useful as a libretto for Bellini or Donizetti. In the
coloratura woes of the modern <i lang="it">diva</i>, the distressed
Elwina would have found her perfect interpretation.</p>

<p>Garrick was so pleased with the success of <cite>Percy</cite>
that he urged Miss More to write another tragedy.
The result was <cite>The Fatal Falsehood</cite>, a romantic tragedy
of the same sort. It was acted late in the spring of
1779, some months after the death of Garrick, and,
though it did not duplicate the success of the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
play, was enthusiastically received. With its production
Miss More’s connection with the London stage
came to an end.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p><cite>The Fatal Falsehood</cite> sinks far below the level of
<cite>Percy</cite>. It probably suffered from the lack of Garrick’s
revising hand; though it is doubtful if even his genius
could have introduced any semblance of reality into a
series of situations so preposterous. Miss More is
usually content to depend upon accident as the source
of her dramatic effects; but in <cite>The Fatal Falsehood</cite> she
attempted to depict in Bertrand a villain as subtle as
Iago. Although he analyzes himself and his motives
in a series of soliloquies, he remains a tangle of absurdities,
and all the action of the piece, which flows from
him, must be similarly described.</p>

<p>Miss More’s dramas, as well as her poems and essays,
were intended to serve the cause of virtue, about which
all bluestockings were seriously concerned. Even
the plays are filled with a sort of portable morality in
the shape of maxims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The treacherous path that leads to guilty deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is, to make vice familiar to the mind.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Miss More never escaped from the office of preceptress;
the forming spirit of all her work is that of the Young
Ladies’ Academy.</p>

<p>In the same year which saw the production of <cite>Percy</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
she put forth a volume entitled <cite>Essays on Several
Subjects, principally intended for Young Ladies</cite>. The
book is of the same sort as Mrs. Chapone’s <cite>Letters</cite>: it
warns young women to be modest, to avoid envy, and
guard against the ‘obliquities of fraud’ in lovers.
Allowing for its hopelessly narrow view of life, it may
be granted that the advice is sound enough. But the
bluestockings never realize that good advice is the
cheapest commodity in the world.</p>

<p><cite>Florio</cite>, a tale somewhat inappropriately dedicated
to Walpole, is a sort of parable in verse, designed to
enforce such lessons as are conveyed in the <cite>Essays</cite>.
The hero, once a slave to frivolous society, is converted
by reading Johnson’s <cite>Idler</cite> and inspecting the
beauties of Nature under the direction of his mistress.</p>

<p>With <cite>Florio</cite> we reach a period in Miss More’s literary
career and the end of what may be called the bluestocking
influence on her work. Her pietism, which
had amused Garrick, was now becoming chronic.
She declined to go and see Mrs. Siddons as Elwina,
because it is wrong to attend the theatre. She deplored
the singing, dancing, and feasting in which
London indulged after King George’s recovery of his
sanity.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> She even objected to the phrase <em>merry Christmas</em>,
as being bacchanalian rather than Christian.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
Walpole, who was naturally distressed by all this,
made a charming attack on Miss More’s Low Church
faith in the Ten Commandments, and pointed out to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
her that she was guilty of the Puritanical heresy.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
The truth is that Miss More’s sense of responsibility
to society at large was weighing on her mind. In
1788 she published a serious call to a more solemn view
of life in her <cite>Thoughts on the Importance of the Manners
of the Great to General Society</cite>, and definitely embarked
upon her career as preceptress in public morality.
Meanwhile she was drawing steadily away from her
fashionable friends. At last she came to think any
association with them almost wicked. On March 12,
1794, she wrote in her diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dined with friends at Mrs. ——. What dost thou
here, Elijah? Felt too much pleased at the pleasure
expressed by so many accomplished friends on seeing
me again. Keep me from contagion!<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Whatever may have been the influence of the bluestockings
upon others, there can be no doubt that for
Hannah More it had been an excellent corrective. It
had at least prevented her from comparing herself to
Elijah.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Montagu as a Patron of the Arts</span></h3>

<p>Above all things Mrs. Montagu longed to send her
reputation down to posterity as an acknowledged
patron of letters. She wished to attach to herself,
after the manner of the French literary ladies, some
poet, essayist, or scholar, whose work she might inspire
and supervise, and whose reward was to be the association
of her name with his. Hannah More, recognizing
this ambition, calls her ‘the female Mæcenas of Hill
Street,’<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and Dr. Burney asserts that she ‘makes each
rising art her care.’<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The poet for whom she had been
waiting appeared in the summer of 1766, in the person
of James Beattie, a young professor of moral philosophy
at Aberdeen, who was, at the time, unknown in
England.</p>

<p>Beattie was by nature shy, nervous, self-conscious,
and uncertain of his powers—a type familiar in the
academic world. He was for ever finding his poems
unworthy of him, suppressing them, altering and correcting
them, and threatening never to complete them.
For such a person a patron might do much. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Montagu at once expressed herself to Dr. Gregory (a
common friend resident in Aberdeen) as highly pleased
with Beattie’s poetry. But it was not until she saw the
first canto of the <cite>Minstrel</cite>, early in 1771, that her
judgment was fully convinced. She now set to work
with as much industry as charity to advance her chosen
poet in the world of letters. She sent a copy of the
new poem to Lord Chatham,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> recommended it to the
attention of Percy (the inspiration of whose essay on
the minstrels had been acknowledged by Beattie in his
preface), and encouraged her <i lang="fr">protégé</i> by quoting to him
the praises of Lord Lyttelton. She offered suggestions
respecting the advertisement of the poem, and
wrote to a bookseller of her acquaintance that he must
recommend the poem ‘to all people of taste.’ Such
were the powers of the female patron in this new age.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu also interested herself in another work
of Beattie’s, a book now quite forgotten but then just
entering upon a brilliant career of popularity. This
was no other than an <cite>Essay on Truth</cite>, which had been
published in 1770, and had almost immediately passed
into a second edition. Mrs. Montagu very flatteringly
describes the vain efforts of the English public to come
at this volume. She has herself recommended it ‘to
many of our Bishops and others; but all have complained
this whole winter that the booksellers deny
having either the first or second edition. I dare say
many hundreds would have been sold if people could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
have got them.’<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> It is quite obvious that the academic
young poet needs the practical assistance of the
bluestocking, friend of ‘Bishops and others.’ He therefore
came up to London in the autumn of this year,
and then first made the acquaintance of the woman
whom he ever after gratefully acknowledged as his
patron. And thus the Defender of Truth and the
Defender of Shakespeare met together—to their
mutual advantage. Mrs. Montagu’s mind was already
teeming with projects for the advancement of
her favourite. In the spring of the next year, upon
hearing that Adam Ferguson of Edinburgh University
was to go abroad, she conceived the plan of having
Beattie transferred to his chair, and succeeded in
interesting the Archbishop of York in the matter, only
to learn that the professor had every intention of returning
to his work after his temporary absence.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
Nevertheless she was the means of introducing Beattie
to the Archbishop and to his brother, Lord Kinnoul,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
who became warm friends of the new poet. In the
following year she instructed Beattie in the best means
of bringing his case to the attention of the King,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
assuring him that if the government did nothing for
him, she would herself ‘claim the honour of rendering
his situation in life more comfortable.’<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
government did not disappoint her. Beattie was
presented to the King at his levee, received the incense
of his praise, and, later, a pension of two hundred
pounds, and a degree of Doctor of Laws from Oxford.
Mrs. Montagu shared in the general praise. ‘Do you
not honour Mrs. Montagu,’ wrote Hester Chapone to
Mrs. Delany, ‘for the pains she has taken to introduce
this <em>excellent champion of Christianity</em> into the notice
of the great world and to obtain for him some other
regard than that of barren fame?’<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Her efforts on his behalf had but begun. Abandoning
a plan that he should enter the Church of England—partly
no doubt because of Beattie’s own lukewarmness—she
thinks he may perhaps do more
service to religion as a layman than as a priest,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and
she now urges the publication, by subscription, of a
quarto volume of <cite>Essays</cite>. In this way, she thought,
eight hundred or a thousand pounds might be gained.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
Patron and <i lang="fr">protégé</i> together drew up a form of ‘subscription-paper,’
and, since Beattie shrank from any
advertisement in newspapers, Mrs. Montagu agreed,
with the assistance of a few friends, to circulate the
document herself.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> She did her work well. In the
list of subscribers to the book<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> she contrived to include
not only every prominent bluestocking, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Reynolds, Garrick, Johnson, a host of peers, her friends
the Bishops, the two Archbishops, and the libraries of
Oxford. She was the recognized sponsor of the volume,
and when the publication of it was delayed, it was part
of her office to circulate an explanatory card of Beattie’s.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
When it finally appeared she was delighted
with it in its every aspect, but professed to find it rather
insolent in a native of Aberdeen to outdo the English
in style.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the second canto of the <cite>Minstrel</cite> had been
sent to her for criticism, and was, if we are to believe
Beattie, published at her request.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Four years later a
volume of select poems was submitted to her with
the request that she suppress those of which she did
not approve; and when at last Beattie put forth the
<cite>Minstrel</cite> in its final form, he requested permission to
dedicate the first canto to her by putting her name into
the last stanza in a space which had been left blank
from the first:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here pause, my gothic lyre, a little while,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The leisure hour is all that thou canst claim.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But on this verse if Montagu should smile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">New strains ere long shall animate thy frame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her applause to me is more than fame;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">And still with truth accords her taste refined.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At lucre or renown let others aim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I only wish to please the gentle mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom Nature’s charms inspire and love of human kind.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sweetness of this languidly conventional note
must have been somewhat spoiled for Mrs. Montagu
by the fact that the lines were written before Beattie
knew her, and were, if we may trust the poet’s biographer,
originally intended for another.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> But there
can be no doubt of Beattie’s gratitude. He honoured
his patroness by naming a son Montagu, and continued
to visit her in London or in Sandelford and to
submit his works to her for her approval,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> that form of
flattery which she coveted most of all. They honoured
each other for many years with a reasonable regularity
of correspondence which, however, does more credit to
their earnestness than to their wit.</p>

<p>The relations of Beattie and Mrs. Montagu continued
serene throughout their lives. Each was grateful
to the other and never failed to make a public
display of that gratitude. Mrs. Montagu bestowed
her favours without offence, and Beattie received them
without any pretence of hesitation. Each was happier
for having known the other. And if the relation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
author and patron must needs exist, theirs is a specimen
of what the relation may be at its best.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The relations of Robert Potter, the translator of
Æschylus, with Mrs. Montagu are of the same general
nature as those of Beattie. It was with trembling
gratitude that he accepted and incredible flattery that
he repaid the favours which the lady bestowed upon
him. Her attention had, it would appear, been caught
by the publication of the Greek tragedian in English,—the
publication of translations being always a
welcome event for bluestockings—and she at once
suggested to the translator the propriety of adding
explanatory notes. He adopted the suggestion, and,
when publishing his Notes in the following year (1778),
improved the opportunity to dedicate not only these
but the original volume to his new-found patron.
In a prefatory letter to her he outdid Beattie in the
use of superlatives. The notes are written, he proclaims,
only because Mrs. Montagu has asked for
them, and with him a hint from that lady is a command;
though he is incapable of understanding why
so accomplished a person should ask for notes, since
she needs them ‘as little as any person alive.’ The
approbation of Mrs. Montagu, he concludes, is ‘the
highest honour any writer can receive.’</p>

<p>Loyalty was one of Mrs. Montagu’s qualities. None
of her <i lang="fr">protégés</i> ever had occasion to complain that she
lost interest or declined support. Her career as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
patron of the arts is sullied by no quarrels; she was
the subject of no anonymous libels from the offended
recipients of her charity. She continued her favours to
Potter, urging him to proceed with his translation of
Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> and appearing prominently among the
subscribers to that volume. She received him at her
assemblies, and, according to a somewhat doubtful
anecdote, presented him to Dr. Johnson.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Johnson,
who considered Potter’s work ‘verbiage’ (doubtless
because it was in blank verse), snubbed the scholar
and mumbled to the bluestocking, ‘Well, well!’ and
‘Well, Madam, and what then?’</p>

<p>This ungracious reception may have helped Mrs.
Montagu in inciting Potter to attack Johnson’s <cite>Lives of
the Poets</cite>, some years later; but, according to Walpole,
the chief aim was ‘to revenge the attack on Lord
Lyttelton.’ There is, I believe, no existing evidence
for this gossip, apart from the pamphlet itself; but
there seems to be no good reason for rejecting it. In
this paper, which, it must be said, is a sufficiently
dignified and worthy pamphlet as pamphlets go,
Potter quotes Mrs. Montagu’s <cite>Essay on Shakspeare</cite>
by way of demolishing Johnson’s criticism of <cite>The Bard</cite>,
and the lady and Bishop Hurd are proclaimed ‘the
two best Critics of this or any other age.’<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Of this
piece of nonsense Walpole has written the last word:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Were I Johnson, I had rather be criticized than
flattered so fulsomely. There is nothing more foolish
than the hyperboles of contemporaries on one another,
who, like the nominal Dukes of Aquitaine and Normandy
at a coronation, have place given to them above
all peers, and the next day shrink to simple knights.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is a pity that Potter could not have known that the
utility of his translations, which have been reprinted
again and again, would outlive the fame of his patron.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A classicist of much more importance than Potter
did not disdain to court Mrs. Montagu. It was in June
1788, that William Cowper published in the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> his pleasant verses <cite>On Mrs. Montagu’s
Feather Hangings</cite>. He had himself not seen the room,
but knew it from the descriptions of his cousin, Lady
Hesketh, who was an aspirant to Mrs. Montagu’s
‘academy.’<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> The poet’s purpose in the presentation
of this poetical tribute seems to have been missed by
his editors; but it is clear that he was yielding to the
pressure of Lady Hesketh and attempting to bring
himself and his forthcoming translation of Homer to
the attention of the bluestocking. The first move was
a failure. Mrs. Montagu, it would seem, took no
notice of the lines in the magazine, though they were
set forth as ‘by the author of <cite>The Task</cite>,’ already a poem
of national fame. In August, Cowper writes to Lady
Hesketh:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To me, my dear, it seemeth that we shall never by
any management make a deep impression on Mrs.
Montagu. Persons who have been so long accustomed
to praise become proof against it.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>
</div>

</figure>

<p class="noindent">It was necessary to adopt a new plan. Two years later
Lady Hesketh decided to approach Mrs. Montagu
herself, and requested Cowper to permit her to show a
portion of the manuscript to that lady. The poet,
who had long since admired the <cite>Essay on Shakspeare</cite>
and who had acquired the most exaggerated notions
of the lady’s learning,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> chose the first two books of the
<cite>Iliad</cite> to present as a sample intending to ‘carry her by a
<i lang="fr">coup de main</i>,’ and employing ‘Achilles, Agamemnon,
and the two armies of Greece and Troy,’ in his charge
upon the bluestocking. To these the sixteenth book
of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> was added by Lady Hesketh. ‘It
was very kind in thee,’ he writes,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> ‘to sacrifice to this
Minerva on my account.’ But Minerva, who was now
seventy, was probably glad to escape from the affair
with a concealment of her ignorance of Homer. She
wrote an enthusiastic, and, be it added, modest letter
to Lady Hesketh about the new translation, and put
her name on the subscribers’ list. Cowper read the
letter and expressed his pride in what was said; and
there the matter ended.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The precise nature and extent of the assistance which
Mrs. Montagu rendered to James Barry, the painter,
it is now impossible to determine. Certain it is that
she consented to be painted by him (in hideous profile)
for that hodge-podge of fresco with which Barry
covered the walls of the Royal Society of Arts. She is
there depicted in her capacity as a patron of the arts.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Towards the centre of the picture,’ writes Barry,
‘is seen that distinguished example of female excellence,
Mrs. Montagu, who long honoured the Society with
her name and subscription.... Mrs. Montagu appears
here recommending the ingenuity and industry
of a young female whose work she is producing.... Between
these ladies [the Duchesses of Devonshire and
Portland] the late Dr. Samuel Johnson seems pointing
out this example of Mrs. Montagu to their Graces’
attention and imitation.’<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The juxtaposition of Johnson and Mrs. Montagu, the
Great Dictator and the female Mæcenas, must have
caused inextinguishable mirth among the spectators
who knew of their great quarrel. Mrs. Montagu’s
resentment at Johnson’s treatment of Lyttelton in the
<cite>Lives of the Poets</cite> has been much discussed; but the
story must be repeated once more for the sake of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]<br><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
light which it throws upon Mrs. Montagu’s ambitions
to control the destinies of literature.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu and Lord Lyttelton had been close
friends for many years preceding the death of the
latter. They had laboured together on the <cite>Dialogues of
the Dead</cite> (to the scandal, Walpole delighted to relate, of
the lady’s postilion<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>); and thus Mrs. Montagu’s
literary fame was, in a way, bound up with the peer’s.
When, eight years after the death of Lyttelton, Johnson’s
account of him appeared, it was found to contain
remarks which did not please the friends of the late
nobleman. Far from being satisfied that he should
have been deemed worthy of inclusion even in so inclusive
a list as Johnson’s, they decided to take offence
because a certain amount of blame was mingled with a
certain amount of praise. Johnson had, for example,
criticised ‘poor Lyttelton’ for thanking the Critical
Reviewers for their commendatory notice of the
<cite>Dialogues of the Dead</cite>; he spoke of Lyttelton’s poems
as having ‘nothing to be despised and little to be admired,’
and of his songs, in particular, as ‘sometimes
spritely and sometimes insipid.’ Here surely is as
much praise as posterity would care to give to Lyttelton;
but it was not sufficient for the women who owed
some part of their reputation to the fact that they had
been intimate with a peer. According to Walpole, it
was Mrs. Vesey who began the attack, but it was certainly
Mrs. Montagu who conducted the campaign.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
The reader of Fanny Burney’s <cite>Diary</cite> is familiar with
the details of this feud; the reader of Walpole will find
four references to it in the letters written at the opening
of 1781.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘She told me,’ writes the latter, ‘as a mark of her
high displeasure, that she would never ask him to
dinner again. I took her side, and fomented the quarrel,
and wished I could have made Dagon and Ashtaroth
scold in Coptic.’<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nothing came of this literary feud save a scene at
Streatham between Johnson and Pepys which frightened
Fanny Burney, and Potter’s attack on the <cite>Lives</cite> which
has been mentioned already; and Mr. Dobson remarks
that modern readers ‘will perhaps wonder what
the dispute was about.’<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> But it is significant as
showing the influence which Mrs. Montagu thought
she exerted in the world of letters, and the means
which she adopted to make her influence felt.</p>

<p>Johnson’s behaviour during this quarrel must, I
think, have been due to something other than wounded
vanity. It was, I am convinced, due to this very
patronage of literature which the bluestockings, with
Mrs. Montagu at their head, were attempting to set
up. There can be no more annoying spectacle than
that of a person to whom wealth and social talents have
given a certain minor position in the literary world,
and who, mistaking gifts for genius, attempts to exalt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
that position to one of authority. This is what Mrs.
Montagu was trying to do. She had, without a shadow
of doubt, achieved a certain influence. She had
bestowed pensions and gifts upon deserving authors
and scholars. She had placed her name on a hundred
subscription lists. She had contributed to the success
of Hannah More’s tragedy, <cite>Percy</cite>, by appearing, more
than once, in a box at the theatre where it was being
performed. Elizabeth Carter and Hester Chapone
(who dedicated her <cite>Letters</cite> to Mrs. Montagu) were
examples of the worthy writer whom she assisted in
one way or another by her unostentatious charity.
Laurence Sterne was content, as early as 1761, to make
her a sort of literary executor,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> ‘not because she is our
cousin—but because I am sure she has a good heart.’
But when, through the influence of flattery, she mistook
her kind heart and her pleasant interest in literature
for the critical authority of a scholar and arbiter, an
authority which can belong to but one or two in any
age, she brought down upon herself, not unnaturally,
the wrath of Johnson and the scorn of Walpole. By
November 1776, she had reached the point where she
could write thus to Garrick:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I must say I felt for Shakspeare the anxiety one
does for a dead friend, who can no longer speak for
himself.’<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>In 1778 she could seriously offer Fanny Burney,
already renowned as the author of <cite>Evelina</cite>, the gift of
her ‘influence,’ adding, ‘We shall all be glad to assist
in spreading the fame of Miss Burney.’<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>She had the desire to direct and to manage which is
characteristic of the experienced woman of fashion, who
knows the value of her personal charm, rather than of
the true literary critic, who is usually a person too
wise to attempt to direct the stream of literature. But
Mrs. Montagu was not content to let that stream flow
as it would. She must bring comedies to the attention
of Garrick<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and suggest subjects to Hannah More<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
and Mrs. Carter;<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> she must guide Potter and encourage
Beattie. In the pride of her power she even attempted
the delicate task of influencing the elections to the
Literary Club; and it would appear that, escaping
the detection of Johnson, she succeeded in her aim, for
her candidate, who was no other than Mr. Vesey, was
chosen. But when she aspired to reverse the estimate
of the greatest living critic and substitute the indulgent
opinion of a personal friend, it is not surprising that
Johnson should somewhat sharply have reminded her
and her coterie of what their opinion was really worth.
Few to-day will be found to regret that the lady’s view
did not prevail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>At one point Mrs. Montagu’s relations with her
<i lang="fr">protégés</i> come dangerously near to farce comedy. Like
all the bluestockings, she was one of the believers in the
genius of Ann Yearsley, the poetical milk-woman of
Bristol, who was regarded for a time as a female Chatterton.
It was part of the work of bluestockings to
discover genius. They had discovered Hannah More;
they had discovered Beattie and Mrs. Chapone; if
they had not discovered Fanny Burney they had at
least ferreted her out of the obscurity in which she
wished to remain. But none of their literary finds
seemed to them so bright with promise as the marvellous
woman who sold milk from door to door in the unpoetical
town of Bristol. It was Miss More who found
her, and who, with Mrs. Montagu, advertised her with
an ardour which does more credit to the quickness of
their sympathies than to the quickness of their wits.</p>

<p>In 1783 Miss More discovered that Ann Yearsley,
the milk-woman who called daily at her house in
Bristol for kitchen-refuse with which to feed her pig,
was accustomed to employ her leisure moments in the
composition of verses. She at once took the woman
in charge, taught her spelling, and the simplest rules of
rhetoric, and after a lapse of some months felt that her
pupil had made such progress that she might safely
submit her verses to bluestocking judgment. The
enthusiasm with which Mrs. Montagu and her friends
received them is significant at once of their eagerness to
assist the development of poetry and of their unfitness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
for the task. Mrs. Montagu had not believed in Woodhouse,
the poetical shoemaker, but a female Chatterton
had more appeal. She wrote to Miss More,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Let me come to the wondrous story of the milk-woman.
Indeed she is one of the nature’s miracles. What force
of imagination! what harmony of numbers! In
Pagan times one could have supposed Apollo had fallen
in love with her rosy cheek, snatched her to the top of
Mt. Parnassus, given her a glass of his best helicon,
and ordered the nine muses to attend her call.’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This hypothesis being unsuitable to a Christian age,
Mrs. Montagu suggests that the Scriptures, the Psalms,
and the Book of Job in particular, may have taught
the artless numbers to flow; whereupon she herself indulges
in a flight:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Avaunt! grammarians; stand away! logicians; far,
far away all heathen ethics and mythology, geometry
and algebra, and make room for the Bible and Milton
when a poet is to be made. The proud philosopher
ends far short of what has been revealed to the simple
in our religion. Wonder not, therefore, if our humble
dame rises above Pindar or steps beyond Æschylus.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Mrs. Montagu joyfully promises her support.</p>

<p>The rest of the blues were hardly less enthusiastic.
Old Mrs. Delany circulated the milk-woman’s ‘proposals’
to print;<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Mrs. Boscawen sent in a ‘handsome
list of subscribers’; the Duchess of Beaufort requested
a visit from Mrs. Yearsley; the Duchess of Portland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
sent a twenty-pound bank-note. Walpole gave her
money and the works of Hannah More.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The Duchess
of Devonshire presented her with an edition of the
English poets. All social London and half of literary
London put its name on the list of subscribers. When,
in 1785, the volume appeared, it was prefaced by a
letter from Hannah More to Mrs. Montagu, telling
Mrs. Yearsley’s story, and recommending her to the
good attentions of Mrs. Montagu, whose delight ‘in
protecting real genius’ is well known. Mrs. Montagu’s
name was, indeed, writ large in the volume. In the
address, <cite>To Stella</cite> (Stella being the milk-woman’s name
for Hannah More), Mrs. Montagu is referred to as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">That bright fair who decks a Shakespeare’s urn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With deathless glories.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Similar adulation is diffused through some seventy
lines of a blank verse poem, <cite>On Mrs. Montagu</cite>. A
passage from this will serve as well as anything to
illustrate ‘Lactilla’s’ powers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo! where she, mounting, spurns the stedfast earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, sailing on the cloud of science, bears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The banner of Perfection.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ask Gallia’s mimic sons how strong her powers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom, flush’d with plunder from her Shakespeare’s page,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She swift detects amid their dark retreats;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Horrid as Cacus in their thievish dens)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Regains the trophies, bears in triumph back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pilfer’d glories to a wond’ring world.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So Stella boasts, from her the tale I learned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pride she told it, I with rapture heard.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Mrs. Yearsley was not loath to address the great in
verse. Mr. Raikes of Manchester, the founder of
Sunday Schools, the Duchess of Portland, and the
Author of <cite>The Castle of Otranto</cite> (genially referred to
as ‘the Honourable H—e W—e’) were all commemorated.
Their influential patronage and sad Lactilla’s
melancholy tale made the volume immediately
successful, and it passed into a fourth edition in 1786.</p>

<p>Lactilla might, however, have been happier had
she been less successful. There had come to her, after
the publication of her book, the not inconsiderable sum
of three hundred and fifty pounds, which Hannah
More held in trust for her. One is not surprised to
learn that Miss More was cautious in paying out this
money to Mrs. Yearsley, nor that this caution impressed
the owner of the money as mere niggardliness.
A sharp quarrel ensued which was fully set forth by
both women, by Hannah More in her letters to Mrs.
Montagu and by the poetess in the preface to her next
volume of verses. It cost the poor milk-woman all her
fine friends and the fine reputation which they had
blown up for her. She sank gradually from view, and
when she died, in 1806, was probably as obscure as
when she was ‘discovered’ some twenty years before.
Had she been of a philosophical temperament, she
might perhaps have extracted some comfort from the
cynical reflection that her fall had been well-nigh as
humiliating to her discoverers and patrons as to herself.
Walpole continued for months to chuckle over the collapse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
of her reputation, asserting that, if wise, she
would now put gin in her milk and kill herself by way of
attaining to an immortality like Chatterton’s;<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> but the
bluestockings were glad to forget the poor creature
and the mischief they had done her, and the pathos of
her latter state moved them only to passionate descriptions
of her ingratitude.</p>

<p>The London salon did not pass away without leaving
behind it serious criticisms by serious people who knew
it well. Thus Wraxall, writing of Mrs. Montagu’s
later assemblies, asserts that the charm departed with
the death of Johnson, ‘who formed the nucleus round
which all the subordinate members revolved.’<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Miss
More, in reference to the same subject, says: ‘The old
little parties are not to be had in the usual style of
comfort. Everything is great and vast and late and
magnificent and dull.’<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> At a period much earlier
than this, Gibbon made an interesting comparison
between French and English society which is worthy
of consideration in any attempt to judge the London
salon. Writing at Paris, in May 1763, he says: ‘Là
[<em>i.e.</em> in London] on croit vous faire plaisir en vous
recevant. Ici on croit s’en faire à soi-même’;<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> and
elsewhere, ‘In two months I am acquainted with more
(<ins class="corr" id="tn-209" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and more agreable'">
and more agreeable</ins>) people, than I knew in London in
two years. Indeed the way of life is quite different.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Much less play, more conversation, and instead of our
immense routs, <ins class="corr" id="tn-210" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'agreable societies'">
agreeable societies</ins> where you know and
are known by almost every body you meet.’<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>There may perhaps be something worth considering
in the suggestion that the Gallic temperament lends
itself more readily than the Saxon to the life and
atmosphere of salons. I have already pointed out that
one characteristic of that life, by which, indeed, its
vitality is to be tested, is the peculiar nature of the
friendships between the hostess and her author-guest.
In London such relations are found, but they seem
tame, cool, and unequal. Passion is unknown in them.
It is inevitable that the salon, if not the literature that
springs from it, should suffer from this lack; and this
contention cannot be dismissed by insisting that authors
are better off without such questionable friendships.
For better or for worse, these made for the production
of literature, and one cannot think of the great Parisian
salons as existing without them.</p>

<p>But we must go farther. The great English authors
in general not only declined to form such intimate
associations in the salons, but looked on literary assemblies
with something approaching contempt, if
indeed they paid any attention whatever to them.
The attitude of Johnson is hardly to be thought of as
an exception to this statement. After his death he
was loudly claimed as a member of the innermost
bluestocking circle, and he was so considered by more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
than one contemporary. Miss More, for example,
in her <cite lang="fr">Bas Bleu</cite> described Johnson as generally participating
in the assemblies of the bluestockings. This
assertion might be quite misleading, if we did not have
Boswell’s <cite>Life</cite> to correct the impression. The amount
of time which Johnson spent in such assemblies is
almost negligible. One smiles to think what a tornado
would have burst from him, had it been hinted to him
that his literary activity was in any way vitalized by
women. The attitude of other authors is even clearer.
Burke was admittedly a renegade from the salons.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
Goldsmith does not appear to have had dignity or
authority enough to interest the bluestockings very
much. Sheridan, who might easily have shone in
salons, was pre-occupied with dramatic and political
affairs. Sterne, Walpole, and Gibbon knew the Parisian
salon too well to have any illusions about its
London offspring. Approaching the matter from the
other side, it must be obvious that the salon could not
win great distinction from those persons who were
content to accept its favours and submit to its influence.
Beattie and Hannah More, the translator of Epictetus
and the translator of Sophocles, and even the author
of the excellent <cite>Cecilia</cite>—these were but feeble luminaries
for an institution, which, if it is to win recognition
at all, must shine with a splendour that is piercing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Even when all this has been taken into account,
the real question is still to ask. Why did not English
authors more generally seek the inspiration and assistance
of this institution? The salon was not without
a certain power: it was generous; it had influence
with publishers and with booksellers; it could bring
authors into pleasant and profitable contact with one
another. But despite all this, the bluestockings never
became, like their French models, true disseminators of
ideas; they were never the devotees of new and daring
philosophies and of radical transitions. They were
always on the side of law and order, and of a conservative
tradition. They stood for the classicism of
English literature. Now no temper could have been
more unfortunate than this at the moment when the
bluestockings sought to exert their influence. The
things which they represented were already passing
away, and with the things that were coming to birth
they felt no profound sympathy. They did, it is true,
show a certain interest in romanticism, and Mrs. Vesey
scandalized her sisters by getting interested in agnosticism;
but the true significance of these things they
never guessed. None of them glimpsed that dawn
in which to be alive was bliss. They were apart from
the whole current of European literature. At the
moment when poets were hearkening to the voices of
new gods, the bluestockings were prolonging faint
echoes of conservatism; at the moment when poetry
was deserting the metropolis and schools of literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
were shattering into individualism, they cast their
influence on the side of a yet closer centralization.
English literature was about to find its true exponents
in two men who were about as far removed from the
influence of salons as can well be imagined, the shy
recluse of Olney, and the passionate poet of the Lowlands.</p>

<p>Thus the salon, judged by classical models, must
be said to have failed. It was born out of its due time.
Had the position of woman in the English literary world
permitted it to flower fifty years earlier, there might
have been a different story to tell. As it is, we must
be content to study it as an interesting attempt to
domesticate a foreign institution and as a revelation
of certain significant features in English literary life.
Conceived in its strictest sense, it is difficult to claim
for the salon more than this.</p>

<p>But there is a freer sense in which the whole movement
may be conceived. We may turn our eyes from
the bluestockings and their somewhat tiresome assemblies
to consider the broader manifestations of the social
instinct. The age which we are studying is unique in
English literature as having struck out or brought to
perfection types of literature which exist solely to
record and celebrate the social life. That body of
work is perhaps its most significant, and certainly its
most characteristic, contribution to English literature.
It is no idle speculation that sees in it the working of
the same spirit which tried to express itself in the salon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Full expression was reserved for this spirit in simpler
forms of social life, and out of these rose a body of
literature worthy to represent it. To this truer manifestation
of the social spirit in letters we now address
our attention.</p>

<span class="smcap">Johnson and the Art of Conversation</span></h3>

<p>Chapters like this usually begin with a lament.
The age of conversation, it is proper to begin, is gone,
gone with the harpsichord and the minuet and the
long, leisurely evenings when the bluestockings discussed
literature and the theory of equality. The rush
of modern life, one continues, has killed conversation,
even as the penny post has killed the art of letter-writing.
In all this there is much false sentiment and false
implication. It is foolish to assume the existence of a
time when talk was universally clever and wise. There
were dullards even in 1780. Cards and dancing, then
as now, were sought as a relief from thinking, and serious
talkers were not seldom voted a nuisance. No doubt
they often were. The bluestockings, as we have seen,
sometimes bored even themselves. The reputation
of the age for conversation depended upon a few.</p>

<p>It is difficult to recover a sufficient body of this conversation
upon which to base an opinion. It is a
much easier thing to read about <ins class="corr" id="tn-217" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'then to get'">
than to get</ins> at. Plenty
of essays on conversation have been preserved—no
manual for young ladies was without one—but the
talk itself is not so easy to find. We have Chesterfield’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
advice to his son on how to shine in conversation,
but the record of Chesterfield’s own discourse is
little better than a collection of puns and bits of repartee,
mere flotsam and jetsam. Cowper wrote a long
and rather dreary poem on colloquial happiness, but
where is Cowper’s conversation? Fielding, too, wrote
an essay on the subject, but it is a rather priggish
affair (for Fielding), and the perusal of it only fills us
with regret that we must take this poor substitute for
the brilliant chatter that went on about the punch-bowl.
The scraps of talk casually embedded in works
on other subjects, the anecdotes, jests, and <i lang="fr">bons mots</i>
have lost with time much of their flavour and significance,
and give us no adequate notion of the distinctive
opinions held by their authors, no grounds for large
general conclusions about them, and no conception of
the general strain of their talk. There is no steady
light from these flashes of eloquence and wit. At most
they make us regret what we have lost. Thus there is
every reason to suppose that the conversation of Richard
Brinsley Sheridan was a model of brilliance; but
the collection of his sayings recorded by Moore is quite
lacking in the grace of reality. These good things are
without a foil; they need arrangement; they are mere
ornaments adorning nothing, a little heap of unset
gems.</p>

<p>To all this there is but one exception, the grand exception
of Boswell’s record of Johnson. Perhaps the
chief distinction of that record is that it gives us not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
only the high lights in the conversation, not only its
exciting moments, but its very <i lang="fr">longueurs</i> (as Horace
Walpole objected), its ineptitude, its occasional inconclusiveness.
There is, therefore, something by which
the wit of it all is set off. It has the ring of vitality.
It is to the everlasting credit of Boswell that he let us
see the worst of Johnson’s talk, that, in the words of
Hannah More, he ‘mitigated none of his asperities,’
but gave us the heaviness as well as the wit and the
rudeness as well as the depth. We hear the voice of
Johnson, not a mere quotation of his words.</p>

<p>But in spite of the obvious faults of Johnson’s
talk, it is difficult to speak of it without a continuous
and perhaps offensive use of superlatives. Age could
not wither Johnson. Instead of impairing his memory,
time enriched it. The pomposity of his written work
never impedes his quickness of wit in conversation.
He was, to be sure, fond of parading that pomposity
of style for the amazement and amusement of his
hearers, and it is scarcely true to say that he used one
style in writing and another in talking. It would be
nearer the truth to say that, as he grew older, he tended
to introduce more of the ease of his talk into his written
work. Sentence after sentence from the <cite>Lives of the
Poets</cite> might be cited to show the almost colloquial
ease of his later manner, and significant parallels might
be drawn. Yet it is certain that conversation gave
more scope to that aptness of homely illustration which
was his most entertaining gift. Posterity is right in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
preferring Johnson’s conversation to his writings, for
while it lacks nothing in the stream of thought and
finish of style that distinguish his writings, it is distinctly
superior in mother wit.</p>

<p>In the heat of conversation Johnson had a stimulus
which he never felt in writing, the joy of personal contention.
He admittedly regarded conversation as a
contest, and was frankly contemptuous of the type of
man who, like Addison or Goldsmith, was always at
his best when he was arguing alone. Of two men
talking, Johnson asserted, one must always rise superior
to the other. For himself he had too much pride to
be contentedly submerged by the conversation of
others. Rather than be worsted, he would strike
below the belt, or, in the words of Boswell, ‘toss and
gore several persons.’ He had a rough and ready way
of escaping from difficulties. When Mrs. Frances
Brooke requested him to look over her new tragedy,
complaining that she herself had no time to revise it,
since she had ‘so many irons in the fire,’ the sage replied,
‘Why, then, Madam, the best thing I can advise
you to do is to put your tragedy along with your irons.’
‘If your company does not drive a man out of his house,
nothing will,’ he said to Boswell because the Scotsman
had ventured to defend the Americans. When he got
the floor—and by the use of such methods he got it
very often—he was not inclined to abandon it, and
the conversation became a monologue. Goldsmith,
who so often had the right in dispute and was, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
one of the wittiest opponents Johnson ever had, complained
that he was ‘for making a monarchy of what
should be a republic.’ Even Boswell admitted that
in Johnson’s company men did not so much interchange
conversation as listen to what was said. But, whatever
lofty notions of conversation we may cherish, it
may be questioned whether it can ever be a republic.
If the flow of talk is to get anywhere, if it is to reach a
conclusion, it must be confined within a rather narrow
channel or it is certain to dissipate itself. Johnson
hated spattering talk. He censured Goldsmith because
he was always ‘coming on without knowing how
he was to get off,’ and asserted that he could not talk
well because he had made up his mind about nothing.
‘Goldsmith,’ said he, ‘had no settled notions upon any
subject; so he talked always at random.’ It was not
so with Johnson. He saw his conclusions and drove
straight towards them, scattering his opponents or
knocking them on the head if they impeded him.</p>

<p>But it would be a mistake to infer that Johnson was
a sort of conversational head-hunter, or the ourang-outang
of the drawing-room whom Macaulay depicts,
alternately howling and growling and rending his
associates in pieces before our eyes. If we have any
respect for the consistent testimony of his contemporaries,
we shall come to realize that he talked somewhat
unwillingly. He had to be drawn out. ‘He was like
the ghosts,’ said Tyers. Nothing annoyed him more
than to be shown off. At the famous Wilkes dinner, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
which he had been taken simply that he might contend
with a worthy opponent, he was so angry when he
realized what had happened that he took up a book,
‘sat down <ins class="corr" id="tn-222" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'upon a widow seat'">
upon a window seat</ins> and read, or at least kept
his eye upon it intently for some time,’ exactly as upon
the very different occasion of his first meeting with
Fanny Burney.</p>

<p>Because of this lack of pliability in Johnson, Boswell
deserves far more credit than he has ever received for
his success in making him talk. Boswell, though not
a profound thinker, was of a mind curious and alert.
He is entirely misjudged by those readers—if, indeed,
they are ever readers—who join Macaulay in thinking
him a fool. Boswell said foolish things, to be sure,
and asked the foolishest questions, as what proportion
of their wages housemaids might properly spend on
their attire, how hogs were slaughtered in the Tahiti
Islands, and what Dr. Johnson would do if he were shut
up in a tower alone with a new-born baby; but under
the silliest of them there is always a keen experimentalist,
an amused observer tickling a giant with a straw.
Boswell introduced a valuable amount of friction into
Johnson’s life, arranged that he should meet men whose
views were wholly opposed to his own, carried him off
to dine with Whigs, got him to call on Lord Monboddo
(who held the most offensive opinions about primitive
man), introduced him to General Paoli, and to Beattie
and Sir Adam Fergusson (of the infamous race of Scots),
and dragged him across all Scotland to Mull and Icomkill.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
No one else so mastered the art of managing Johnson
as this same wily Scot. Mrs. Thrale could not do
it. Neither Goldsmith nor Dr. Taylor could do it.
Topham Beauclerk might perhaps have done it, had
he thought it worth while. Fanny Burney had the
subtle combination of grace and ability which appealed
to Johnson, but was lacking in force. When she attempted
to show Johnson to her ‘Daddy Crisp,’ or to
engage him in conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Greville,
her failure was conspicuous. The great man’s placid
self-absorption gave a deeper offence than any tirade
could have done.</p>

<p>Johnson had at times so serene a manner that, in
an affable moment, he declared to Boswell that ‘that
is the happiest conversation where there is no competition,
no vanity, but a calm, quiet interchange of
sentiments.’ Such is the general strain of his conversation
at Streatham, as recorded by Miss Burney.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
Here we detect a playfulness, even a frivolity, of manner
which is a pleasant contrast to the more professional
tone with which Boswell has familiarized us. There is
in it no hint of dress parade. It is a very human
conversation, containing most of the faults that disgrace
our own. Johnson gossips. He talks of the
weather; he talks of his friends behind their back—what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
true comrade ever failed to do that?—and will
even indulge in a bit of scandal. He talks of Sheridan’s
marriage with the beautiful prima donna, Elizabeth
Linley, and of Goldsmith’s fracas with his Welsh publisher,
Evans; and censures or defends Garrick or
Foote as the mood impels. There are even moments
when he emulates Goldsmith and makes himself a
laughing-stock for the delectation of his friends.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Our roasting,’ he once remarked, when describing
the state of his kitchen, ‘is not magnificent, for we
have no jack.... Small joints, I believe, they manage
with a string, and larger are done at the tavern.
I have some thoughts (with profound gravity) of
buying a jack, because I think a jack is some credit
to a house’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ remarked Mr. Thrale, ‘but you’ll have a
spit, too?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, no; that would be superfluous; for we shall
never use it; and if a jack is seen, a spit will be presumed!’</p>
</div>

<p>This feature of the Johnsonian manner, which might
almost be compared with Goldsmith’s fondness for the
rôle of fool, has been generally overlooked. One may
doubt whether even Boswell was more than dimly
aware of it. Yet there can be little doubt that Johnson
enjoyed assuming and playing a part. He was certainly
not a bear, but he enjoyed playing the bear,
and hugged his victims to death that the world might
laugh. It was his peculiar misfortune to play the rôle
too well, as it was Goldsmith’s misfortune to play the
fool too well. Again, Johnson was assuredly not at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
heart a pompous man; yet he could in a moment
assume pomposity and drop into the rôle of Gargantua.
But he sometimes created such consternation in the
part that the world did not dare to laugh. Thus, in
the trite old illustration of his remark about Buckingham’s
<cite>Rehearsal</cite>, he revised the crisp sentence, ‘It has
not wit enough to keep it sweet,’ into the crazy pomposity
of, ‘It has not vitality enough to preserve it
from putrefaction.’ It is amazing that Macaulay
and the world of readers after him could delude themselves
into thinking that Johnson was seriously attempting
to improve this sentence. It was, on the contrary,
a pose worthy of Laurence Sterne. It was a favourite
device of a true humourist putting forth a caricature
of himself. Instances of it could be multiplied indefinitely.
Remarking on the morality of the <cite>Beggars’
Opera</cite>, for example, he said, ‘It may have some influence
for evil by making the character of a rogue familiar,
and in some degree pleasing’; then with the familiar
shift of style, ‘There is in it such a <em>labefactation</em> of all
principles as to be injurious to morality.’ Gibbon
and Cambridge, who were present, could regard this
stylistic somersault as an attempt at critical dignity,
and even Boswell felt that he must smother his mirth.
Fanny Burney, had she been there, would, I imagine,
have smiled confidently in Johnson’s face, for she
appreciated this aspect of his talk better than others.
It is to her that we owe Johnson’s delicious criticism
of his pensioners, and, in particular of the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Miss Poll Carmichael: ‘I could make nothing of her;
she was wiggle-waggle, and I could never persuade her
to be categorical.’</p>

<p>But however dull the eighteenth century may have
been in apprehending this type of humour, it did full
justice to the more serious side of Johnson’s conversation.
It was chiefly impressed, as every age must be,
with the scope and versatility of the man’s mind. It is
of course the merest platitude to remark that Johnson’s
conversation is characterized by breadth of interest
and accuracy of information; yet, like many platitudes,
it is essential to an examination of the subject. It is
most significant of the man and of the age in which he
lived—so far removed from the narrowness of our
own age of specialization—simply to turn the pages of
Boswell’s <cite>Life</cite> and note the number of topics upon
which Johnson talked with that easy mastery which
distinguishes the scholar and philosopher from the
promiscuously well-informed man of the world. Take,
for example, the topics touched upon in a dozen consecutive
pages of the book, chosen at random; evidence
for supernatural appearances, the Roman Church,
the thirty-nine articles of the Church of England, the
Royal Marriage Bill, the respect due to old families,
the art of mimicry, the word <em>civilisation</em> (‘shop’ was
evidently not an excluded topic), vitriol, the question,
Was there one original language? the relation of Erse
to Irish, the rights of schoolmasters, in the infliction
of punishment, the Lord Chancellors, the Scotch accent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
the future state of the soul, prayers for the dead, the
poet Gray, Akenside, Elwal the heretic, the question,
Is marriage natural to man? (it seems that it is not),
the philosophy of beauty, swearing, the philosophy of
biography, the proper use of riches, the philosophy of
philanthropy. Here surely is a sufficiently varied
list. But no mere enumeration can give any notion
of the novelty of Johnson’s thinking. His remarks
are no echo, no quotation. They are the natural
up-welling of an original mind, showing us that Johnson
was a philosopher; but they also reveal a fund of
accurate detail and an ability to quote chapter and
verse, showing us that Johnson was a scholar. These
two offices may be quickly illustrated from the topics
enumerated above. When Boswell introduced the
subject of the future state of the soul, he made the
highly conventional observation that ‘one of the most
pleasing thoughts is that we shall see our friends
again.’ Whereupon Johnson replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yes, Sir; but you must consider, that when we are
become purely rational, many of our friendships will
be cut off. Many friendships are formed by a community
of sensual pleasures: all these will be cut off.
We form many friendships with bad men, because they
have agreeable qualities, and they can be useful to us;
but, after death, they can no longer be of use to us.
We form many friendships by mistake, imagining people
to be different from what they really are. After
death, we shall see every one in a true light. Then,
Sir, they talk of our meeting our relations: but then
all relationship is dissolved; and we shall have no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
regard for one person more than another, but for their
real value. However, we shall either have the satisfaction
of meeting our friends, or be satisfied without
meeting them.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is Johnson the philosopher. Five minutes later,
Boswell was saying, ‘I have been told that in the
Liturgy of the Episcopal Church of Scotland, there
was a form of prayer for the dead,’ to which Johnson
replied, ‘Sir, it is not in the liturgy which Laud framed
for the Episcopal Church of Scotland; if there is a
liturgy older than that, I should be glad to see it.’
There is Johnson the scholar.</p>

<p>It would be rash to assert that Johnson was always
on safe ground, and ludicrous to assert that he was
always right. He enjoyed a random shot at the truth
as well as any other man whose chief interest is in the
vitality of his thinking rather than in the literalness
of his conclusions; but it was a diversion which he
seldom permitted to others, and a tendency in himself
which was generally restrained by the specialists about
him. Here we have a truly formative element in the
social life of the time.</p>

<p>But no man of the eighteenth century could hold his
hearers simply by the display of a wealth of information.
Brilliancy of manner was as indispensable as breadth
of mind. ‘Weight without lustre is lead,’ wrote Lord
Chesterfield. No good talker was without a superficial
attraction. Garrick was noted for the histrionic
quality, Beauclerk for acidity, and Goldsmith for Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
humour. Johnson’s conversation, from the inner fire
of it, was for ever sparkling into wit and epigram. Yet
he never made the mistake of serving his friends with
nothing but epigrams, which is very like serving
one’s guests with nothing but <i lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</i>. Epigram
stimulates the appetite, but does not satisfy it, and will
not do for a steady diet. It is with Johnson, however,
something more than a mannerism. It was the form
that lent itself best to the expression of his critical
faculty. An examination of Johnson’s literary criticism
will reveal the fact that his method is prevailingly
sententious and summary. He was impatient of a
long and slow development of thought, nor did he
‘wind into’ a subject, like Burke. In reading the
<cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>, we do not feel that matters are gradually
illuminated, but that they are revealed by sudden
flashes. If his criticism offends, it is usually because
it is a final pronouncement and is too summary to
be adequate. When he attempts an orderly criticism
of details, the method, though more elaborate,
is usually less satisfying. He is at his best when he is
most crisp and dogmatic: ‘If Pope be not a poet, where
is poetry to be found?’ ‘Dryden is read with frequent
astonishment, and Pope with perpetual delight.’ ‘His
page,’ he says of Addison, ‘is always luminous, but
never blazes in unexpected splendour.’ The value of
Johnson’s criticism consists in such sentences as these,
not in longer passages of sustained comment like the
analysis of Gray’s <cite>Bard</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>Now whatever charm or power there is in such a
method is found also in Johnson’s conversation. There
is the same pointed style, the same finality of tone, and
often the same irritating quality: ‘No man,’ said he of
Goldsmith, ‘was more foolish when he had not a pen
in his hand, or more wise when he had.’ ‘That man
[Lyttelton] sat down to write a book to tell the world
what the world had all his life been telling him.’ ‘All
theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience
for it.’ ‘In republics there is not a respect for authority,
but a fear of power.’ Many profess to dislike
such an epigrammatic style as this; but I incline to
think that those who protest most loudly against such
<i lang="la">dicta</i> are those who are least capable of thinking them
out. At any rate, if they accomplished no more, such
statements gave something to attack, and the desire
to demolish is of the very soul of conversation.</p>

<p>Those who are offended by such a conversational
method might attack it more effectively by pointing
out that it was often employed to startle rather than to
instruct. Johnson felt the normal human desire to
shock people, and indulged to the full his transitory
moods. ‘Rousseau,’ he would exclaim, ‘is a very bad
man. I should like to have him work in the plantations!’
‘I am willing to love all mankind, <em>except an
American</em>.’ In a fit of petulance he even quoted with
approval the ridiculous remark, ‘For anything I can
see, foreigners are fools.’ There is no deliberation in
such words; it is, in truth, hardly fair to quote them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
At any rate, they are entirely misleading when taken
out of their setting; for it is the charm of conversation
that it is not deliberate, and that a talker may dare to
have a prejudice as well as an opinion. A good talker
will ‘paint a man highly’ for the mere love of painting.
Voltaire and all free talkers with him are guilty of the
same excesses. Madame Necker tells us that in listening
to Voltaire it was necessary to distinguish the
statements that were truly characteristic of the man
from those which were dictated by the passing mood
and were no more than the <i lang="fr">vérité du moment</i>. It is the
peculiar office of conversation thus to give the whole
man, with all his faults upon his head, all his lapses
from sense and self-consciousness, all his irrationalities
and inconsistencies: it is these things that show that
he is human. It was Johnson himself who remarked
that in conversation ‘you never get a system.’ Let us
be grateful that it is so. A ‘unified’ person, a man
whose mind is governed by a system, cannot converse;
he can only lecture. His thoughts flow like a canal,
not like a river. He is really the most limited of men,
for he must live within his system as he lives within
his income. It is the glory of Johnson’s conversation
that you cannot make a system out of it. For a
system you must go to the <cite>Rambler</cite> or <cite>The Vanity of
Human Wishes</cite>.</p>

<p>But this is not to say that Johnson had no conversational
principles or that he uttered thoughts
merely because they were novel. His ‘stream of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
mind’—to use one of his own phrases—was free,
but it was not therefore without a very definite trend.
Like a stream again, he drew constantly upon his
sources, certain general conclusions about life, which
really control his conversation. He himself declared
that general principles were not to be had from a man’s
talk, but from books. Certainly this dictum does not
apply to his own talk, for general principles are obvious
enough in it. It is quite evident that we are listening to
a man who has made up his mind about life and about
what is worth while. If, unlike Goldsmith, he talked
well in public, it was because, like Imlac, he had thought
well in private. It is his constant custom to bring the
casual topic immediately into the realm of general
principles, and thus the talk about a particular subject
becomes a philosophy of it. Boswell realized this, and
introduced topic after topic in order to get it cleared
up once for all. ‘I <em>wished to have it settled</em>,’ he says,
‘whether duelling was contrary to the laws of Christianity.’
He always felt that Johnson could have
settled the whole matter of necessity and freewill, if
only he had been willing to talk about it. Of a lady
talking with Johnson of the resurrection body, he
naïvely remarks, ‘She seemed desirous of knowing
more, but he left the question in obscurity.’ Such is
his confidence in his master’s method.</p>

<p>It is always profitable to delve through Johnson’s
talk to the philosophy that underlies it; but not
unfrequently he spares us the trouble by enunciating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the principle himself. Thus when the subject of gaming
arose, he pronounced as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir, I do not call a gamester a dishonest man; but
I call him an unsocial man, an unprofitable man. Gaming
is a mode of transferring property without producing
any intermediate good. Trade gives employment
to numbers, and so produces intermediate good.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Whether this doctrine be economically sound I do not
know; but it is plainly a <em>doctrine</em>. He delighted in such
formulation of principles. Thus when Hume’s statement
that all who are happy are equally happy was
quoted to him, he replied with a definition of happiness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir, that all who are happy are equally happy is not
true. A peasant and a philosopher may be equally
<em>satisfied</em>, but not equally <em>happy</em>. Happiness consists
in a multiplicity of agreeable consciousness. A peasant
has not capacity for having equal happiness with a
philosopher.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In like manner, he deduced principles of æsthetics
from a teacup, and demolished the theory of equality
by inviting the footman to sit down and dine.</p>

<p>But Johnson’s conversation is more than a <i lang="la">reductio
ad principia</i>, as it is more than epigram and more than
information. Philosophic in method, it was creative in
effect. It fertilized other minds, and attained to new
life long after it was uttered and forgotten. Johnson
cannot be measured by one who reads only his writings,
but he can be measured by one who reads only his
conversation. Thus his work is linked with that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
men who have accomplished more by the spoken word
than by the written thought, so that, on the one hand,
it has its place in the history of table-talk, like that of
Selden and Coleridge, and, on the other, typifies the
relation of society and letters at its best. By the
dynamic force of his conversation Johnson developed
men, he woke in them powers of which they did not
know themselves to be possessed, and raised them to
higher levels of attainment than his own. Men listened
to him with rage or with wonder, as the Hebrews to a
prophet and the Romans to a Sibyl, and they scoffed
or recorded according to their mood. Of much of
this Johnson was, fortunately, unconscious. He regarded
his books as his chief influence upon the world.
‘Now, Sir,’ said he, ‘the good I can do by my conversation
bears the same relation to the good I can do by
my writings that the practice of a physician retired to
a small country town, does to his practice in a great
city.’ But Boswell saw more clearly. ‘To me,’ he
said, ‘his conversation seemed more remarkable than
even his writings.’ When, in 1776, Boswell returned
to Johnson’s side, he felt at once the electric force.
‘I felt myself elevated as if brought into another state
of being,’ he wrote; and said to Mrs. Thrale, ‘I am quite
restored by him, by transfusion of <em>mind</em>.’ The cynical
will of course dismiss this as a spasm of hero-worship;
but it is more than that. No one will be inclined to
accuse Edmund Burke of worshipping Johnson, yet
he remarked: ‘To the conversation of this truly great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
man I am proud to acknowledge that I owe the best
part of my education.’ Orme the historian remarked
that in conversation Johnson gave one either ‘new
thoughts or a new colouring.’ Testimony of an even
more striking character may be quoted from Reynolds.
Speaking of his own <cite>Discourses on Art</cite>, Reynolds said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whatever merit they have must be imputed, in a
great measure, to the education which I may be said to
have had under Dr. Johnson. I do not mean to say,
though it would certainly be to the credit of these
Discourses if I could say it with truth, that he contributed
even a single sentiment to them: but he qualified
my mind to think justly.... The observations
which he made on poetry, on life, and on everything
about us, I applied to our art.</p>
</div>

<p>Those who heard the conversation of Johnson may
be said to have witnessed literature in the making.
At any rate, Johnson’s talk became literature by the
simple fact of being recorded. It is the best example
that can be given of the fusion of the literary life with
the social, and brought to bear the same kind of influence
which the salons were trying to exert. It was
destined to give Johnson his distinctive place in the
literature. It was regarded, and properly, by Boswell
as constituting the peculiar value of his <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>,
and as it was the chief inspiration, so it remains the
chief attraction of that remarkable book.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="smcap">Walpole and the Art of Familiar Correspondence</span></h3>

<p>The golden age of English letter-writing arrived
without a period of long and painful preparation.
With the more rudimentary correspondence of the seventeenth
century, the new art had but the slightest relations,
appearing in full bloom almost as soon as it
appeared at all. There was of course much in England
to encourage it. It is significant, for example,
that the era of letter-writing was coincident with the
production of large numbers of novels in letter-form,
which made the art the vehicle of a new realism, and
thus helped to spread the popularity of both types
at once. Again, the era was also that of the development
of the salons and of the art of conversation, a
coincidence which is duplicated in the literary history
of France.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Letter-writing, considered as a familiar
art—and we have no concern with its other aspects—is
but written conversation, a sort of <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>,
with the talking, for the moment, all one side. It is
dominated by a smiling intimacy, and it is this note<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
which one feels to be a new thing in the correspondence
of the eighteenth century, a note which is heard but
seldom in the letters of an earlier period. The models
of the new style were, in fact, not English. When
Chesterfield was choosing exemplars for his son, he
took no account of English letter-writers; he cites
Cicero and Cardinal d’Ossat as models for serious correspondence,
and then adds: ‘For gay and amusing
letters, for <i lang="fr">enjouement</i> and <i lang="fr">badinage</i>, there are none that
equal Comte Bussy’s and Madame Sévigné’s. They
are so natural that they seem to be the extempore conversation
of two people of wit rather than letters.
I would advise you to let that book be one of your
itinerant library.’<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The regard for Madame de Sévigné
was well-nigh universal. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
who probably found her too womanly, is almost alone
in her dislike. Thomas Gray has been said to imitate
her.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Fanny Burney, who had read her from the days
of her youth, considered her ‘almost all that can be
wished to form female perfection,’ felt attached to her as
though she were alive and in the same room, and longed
to run into her arms.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Mrs. Boscawen created an
almost national sensation by circulating a rumour of
the discovery in France of five hundred new letters
of Madame de Sévigné. All the blues were in a flutter
over it. Mrs. Montagu wrote to Hannah More that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the truth of the matter would be evident at once upon
publication, since Madame de Sévigné’s style was ‘of
all things the most inimitable.’<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Miss More yielded
to none in her admiration, and in one of her happiest
phrases compares her to a ‘master sketching for his
own amusement.’ But all this admiration is as nothing
compared with the worship which Walpole gave the
French writer. ‘My dear Madame de Sévigné,’ he
calls her, ‘that divine woman,’ ‘my saint,’ and ‘Notre
Dame de Livry.’ He collected relics of her with a
fervour fairly religious, and enshrined them under her
portrait. The cult became a jest among his friends.
Madame du Deffand sent him a snuff-box, with the
likeness of Madame de Sévigné painted upon it, and
wrote a letter as from the lady herself to accompany
the gift:</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p class="center">Des champs Elisées.<br>

(Point de succession de tems; point de date.)</p>

<p>Je connois votre folle passion pour moi; votre
enthousiasme pour mes lettres, votre vénération pour
les lieux que j’ai habités: J’ai appris le culte que vous
m’y avez rendu: j’en suis si pénétrée que j’ai sollicité
et obtenu la permission de mes Souverains de vous
venir trouver pour ne vous quitter jamais. J’abandonne
sans regret ces lieux fortunés; je vous préfère à
tous ses habitans: jouissez du plaisir de me voir; ne
vous plaignez point que ce ne soit qu’en peinture; c’est
la seule existence que puissent avoir les ombres....<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When people bored Walpole with talk of Shakespeare
and Swift, he would set his thoughts upon Madame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
de Sévigné<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> as a monk takes refuge in holy meditation.
‘If she could have talked nonsense,’ he cries, ‘I should,
like any other bigot, believe she was inspired.’<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Worshipping her thus, it is not surprising that he
should have been, even in his own day, compared to
her.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> He affected to regard such praise as blasphemy;
but, though he was in all probability secretly pleased,
he was too great an artist in his own way not to realize
that there was a difference between him and the goddess
of his idolatry. It is typical of this difference that one
thinks instinctively of Walpole as the ‘prince of letter-writers’
and of Madame de Sévigné as a friend. Walpole
was too strongly individualist to be quite the
‘perfect medium’ that we find in the marquise. We
are conscious of his cleverness, his prejudices, his distortions,
his rank and snobbishness. We think of
Walpole as often as we think of Walpole’s news. His
art is not, however, the less perfect, but only different
in method. He does not, like Madame de Sévigné,
simply transmit the light, but stains and fractures
it so that it glows with a confusion of colours and
flashing rays. Walpole could never have attained to
the pearl-like perfection of Madame de Sévigné. If we
must needs deal in parallels, we shall find a much closer
one between Madame de Sévigné and William Cowper.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
The recluse of Olney, like the Lady of Livry, had caught
the secret of the unpremeditated art. Walpole—like
the prince that he is—is almost never free from a sense
of his rank.</p>

<p>I am tempted to say that this self-consciousness of
Walpole is an art in itself. He enjoys displaying
various sides of himself, plays with his prejudices,
exaggerates all his enthusiasms and all his dislikes,
affects to be old and look back over a vista of years,
jests about his gout and the infallible bootikins, pretends
to believe that the country is going to the dogs,
and takes refuge at Strawberry Hill among his cats
and his cameos. There are moments when he is as
full of humours as Charles Lamb. Throughout three
thousand letters his sprightliness, that subtle union
of wit and grace, is hardly once at fault; everything
seems to contribute to it. Does he cross the Channel
in rough weather? He is drowned without being shipwrecked.
He has a ‘lap full of waves,’ is ‘washed from
head to foot in the boat at ten o’clock at night,’ and
plunged into the sea up to his knees. ‘<i lang="fr">Qu’avois-je à
faire dans cette galère?</i> In truth, it is a little late to be
seeking adventures.’<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Condemned to a state of eternal
emaciation, none shall outdo him in the description
of his leanness: he is ‘emaciated, wan, wrinkled,’ a
‘poor skeleton,’ a ‘thinner Don Quixote.’ Nor is he
surpassed (even by Macaulay) in his account of the
‘tinsel glories’ of Strawberry Hill. He would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
have been the first to call himself a snob, had he known
the word, or had it occurred to him to invent it. Meanwhile
he made no pretence of concealing his boredom
with most things in heaven and earth: to three-quarters
of the world he displayed only a polished indifference;
most of the rest of it he openly despised, but it was that
he might have the more attention for the few whom he
found worth while. His career in the Parisian salons,
which has been already described, his repudiation of the
<i lang="fr">philosophes</i> and the complete absorption of his interest
in Madame du Deffand, are really typical of the man
and of his entire career. If to be loyal through life to
a few friends, to expend one’s genius in giving them
delight—‘spreading one’s leaf gold over them and
making them shine’—is to be a snob, then Walpole
richly deserves the name.</p>

<p>There is no lack of naturalness in Walpole’s relations
with his friends. He always ‘lets himself go,’ to a
degree, indeed, that is surprising when one recalls that
he knew all along that his letters would one day be
printed. Like Johnson,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> he feared the press, which, he
says, ‘exceeds even the day of Judgement, for it brings
to light everybody’s faults, and a good deal more.’<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
He was in nervous dread that his letters to Madame du
Deffand would get into print, and made the poor lady
wretched by harping upon his fear; on the other hand,
he himself collected and prepared certain of his letters
for print; and yet, in spite of all this, there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of restraint in his style or of caution in his words.
He never sues for the good opinion of posterity by
adopting a judicial tone, but is always delightfully
himself. He knew that his letters to Sir Horace Mann,
which extend through forty-five years with hardly a
break, would one day be an invaluable record of public
events,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and was concerned that it should be kept
intact; yet for all that he is never betrayed into the
manner of the archivist. So strong, indeed, is Walpole’s
individualism, so wayward his humour, that it is
sometimes rash to use his letters as documentary
evidence.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no species of literature more
exposed to misinterpretation than the familiar letter.
It may almost be stated as a general law of the species
that in proportion as a letter is suited for print and for
public reading, it is a poor thing. A letter is, by
its very nature, not addressed to an audience, but to an
individual; and as certainly as it becomes general in
its appeal, it loses that intimacy of tone which is its
peculiar charm. What is duller than an ‘open letter’?
What is more chilling than a postscript which invites
you, when you have read a letter, to pass it on to John
and to Mary? Not there shall you find anything of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
that conversation apart which constitutes the joy of
writing as of reading letters. The letter which is
intelligible to everybody is already impersonal and
almost professional in tone, and you may print it with
impunity; but a letter which is addressed to a friend
will, in proportion to its intimacy, teem with allusions,
oddities of phrase, and obscure references which make
full sense only to the recipient, and you will print it
at your peril. Lockhart, who declined to ‘Boswellize’
Scott, has given full expression to this fact, contending
that if conversation is not to be misunderstood, ‘it is
a necessary pre-requisite that we should be completely
familiar with all the interlocutors, and understand
thoroughly all their minutest relations, and points of
common knowledge.... In proportion as a man is
witty and humorous, there will always be about him
and his a widening maze and wilderness of cues and
catchwords, which the uninitiated will, if they are bold
enough to try interpretation, construe, ever and anon,
egregiously amiss—not seldom into arrant falsity.’
Now all this is at least as true of letter-writing<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> as of
conversation. It is, one might argue, never safe to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
attempt to understand a familiar letter until you know
all about the author of it, and almost as much about the
recipient; for the letter is but the resultant of the first
force working upon the second.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that no good letter should
ever be printed. A published letter courts all manner
of misconstruction, and exacts premature payment for
those idle words whereof we are one day to give account.
Few men would willingly yield up the intimacies
of their private correspondence to the cruelty
of public scrutiny and criticism; it is disturbing to
think how much of our published correspondence
would perish if the wish of the writer could effect it.</p>

<p>And yet it is this very unsuitability for print, it is
this baffling intimacy, the covert allusions, the obscure
language of friendship, that attract us to published
correspondence. The pleasure in reading it is the fun
of seeing, once in your life, what was never intended for
your eye. Every printed letter seems to reproach us in
its revelation of a trust betrayed. There is thus something
almost unholy in the joy of reading published
letters. It is never quite a respectable thing to be
doing. There is something of the eavesdropper in it;
it savours of intrusion and at times even of listening at
keyholes. One must be a kind of busybody to find
out what it all means. Sprightly letters are often as
obscure as an overheard conversation: witness the
following extract from a letter of Walpole to Thomas
Gray:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>George Selwyn says I may, if I please, write Historic
Doubts on the present Duke of G. too. Indeed they
would be doubts, for I know nothing certainly.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is wit here and more than one sly allusion; but
it is only by prying rather deeply into old scandals
that you discover the full meaning of the passage.
Familiar correspondence soon comes to need a wealth
of annotation. Walpole speaks of certain letters of
Gray to him as not ‘printable yet,’ on the ground that
they are ‘too obscure without many notes.’<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> But all
the editorial art in the world will not restore the quondam
lustre. ‘If one’s tongue,’ Walpole writes to George
Montagu, ‘don’t move in the steps of the day, it is
only an object of ridicule, like Mrs. Hobart in her
cottillon.’ The brilliancy of this passage is bound up
with the precarious fame of Mrs. Hobart, nay, with
the yet more precarious fame of her dancing. Its
elusiveness is an indication of the unfathomable quality
in letters.</p>

<p>Walpole was himself an insatiable reader of letters,
and understood and analyzed his ruling passion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fools! yes, I think all the world is turned fool, or was
born so; <i lang="fr">cette tête à perruque</i>, that wig-block the Chancellor,
what do you think he has done? Burnt all his
father’s correspondence with Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot
&amp;c.—why do you think? because several of the letters
were indiscreet. To be sure he thought they would
go and publish themselves, if not burnt, but indeed I
suspect the indiscretion was that there were some truths
which it was not proper to preserve, considering <em>considerandis</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
That is just what I should like to have
seen. There was otherwise so much discretion, and
so little of anything else except hypocrisy in all the
letters of those men that have appeared, that I should
not so much regret what discreet folly has now burnt.
Apropos, did I ever tell you a most admirable <i lang="fr">bon mot</i> of
Mr. Bentley? He was talking to me of an old devout
Lady St. John, who burnt a whole trunk of letters of
the famous Lord Rochester, ‘for which,’ said Mr.
Bentley, ‘her soul is now burning in heaven.’ The
oddness, confusion and wit of the idea struck me of all
things.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">‘That is just what I should like to have seen’—there is
the passion of the letter-monger. It was all very indiscreet,
no doubt, but ‘that is just what I should like to
have seen.’ The indiscretion is the best proof that
the correspondence was intimate, that it was not a
mere series of messages nor a volume of essays. To
burn it was an eminently safe thing to do with it—and
eminently deplorable.</p>

<p>A good letter-writer, a Walpole, a Lamb, is hardly
more concerned with the cause of edification than with
the cause of discretion. His concern is with the news.
He moves genially along the lower levels of life, content
to ramble rather than to soar, and forgets high philosophies
and abstract truths. What he offers his friend is
companionship, not education. The news of yesterday
is frequently a harder thing to get at than the learning
of the ages, and all the wisdom of the east will not
make a good letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>This ideal of familiar correspondence was fully
stated in the eighteenth century. It would be possible
to construct a whole philosophy of the subject by marshalling
a series of quotations from eighteenth century
letters. Even the bluestockings appreciated the artlessness
of letters. Hannah More never wrote wiser
sentences than these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If I want wisdom, sentiment or information, I can
find them much better in books than in letters. What
I want in a letter is a picture of my friend’s mind, and
the common sense of his life. I want to know what he
is saying and doing: I want him to turn out the inside
of his heart to me, without disguise, without appearing
better than he is, without writing for a character. I
have the same feeling in writing to him. My letter is
therefore worth nothing to an indifferent person, but
it is of value to my friend who cares for me.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Madame du Deffand, no unworthy successor of Madame
de Sévigné, would have subscribed to all this. She, too,
thought that physics and metaphysics had no place in
correspondence, and detested the letters of Abelard and
Héloïse because they lacked the note of intimacy and
were filled with fustian, ‘<i lang="fr">faux</i>, <i lang="fr">exagéré</i>, <i lang="fr">dégoûtant</i>.’
She begs Walpole to fill his letters with trifles, to send
news of his dogs, Vachette and Rosette, to describe his
curios, and to omit politics. ‘<span lang="fr">J’aime tous les détails
domestiques.... Dans les lettres de Madame de
Sévigné c’est un des articles qui me plaît le plus.</span>’<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Here was a correspondent worthy of Walpole’s quill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>It was long the custom to sneer at Walpole for his
gossip. Lord Macaulay did not fail to ridicule him
for it in language as unmeasured as that of scandal
itself; but Macaulay’s manner is now giving way to
apologies and vindications hardly less damaging.
Walpole was indubitably and incorrigibly a gossip—why
should we avoid the word? He did not avoid it.
He was, on the contrary, the first to make the charge.
As early as 1749 he calls his letters to Horace Mann
‘gossiping gazettes’; yet these are perhaps as little
open to the charge as any letters that he wrote. The
same charge was brought against Walpole’s idol,
Madame de Sévigné. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu
could find in her letters nothing but gossip—‘sometimes
the tittle-tattle of a fine lady; sometimes that of
an old nurse, always tittle-tattle.’<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> A similar charge
may be brought against Cowper, Lamb, Jane Carlyle,
and all favourite letter-writers. It is always ready to
hand for those who prefer disquisitions to news. As
for Walpole’s letters, they might almost be conceived
as a delightful defence of the vice.</p>

<p>Now gossip is of course a very dreadful business;
but its most hardened opponents can scarcely deny
that it has at times been the staple of some very fine
literature indeed. What is Pepys but gossip? What
would Boswell be without his gossip? Even work that
professes to attack gossip is often interesting chiefly
for its illustration of what it denounces. Look at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
career of Lady Teazle. As long as she retains her place
in the Scandal School, she is human, almost lovable,
and wholly delightful; but as soon as she is reformed,
she becomes quite insignificant. Her entrance in the
fifth act is the dullest moment in the play, and her
demeanour is wholly unconvincing and perhaps untruthful.
One cannot think of her apart from her
glittering geysers of scandal; when she gives up gossip
she is as dull as Maria, and we are glad that the play
is over. If there is a more depressing spectacle than a
bird that has lost its wings, it is a wit that has bridled
the tongue.</p>

<p>Gossip, in its milder stages, may even denote a
serene interest in the little affairs of life, which is truly
admirable. Cowper’s letters, which Lady Mary would
no doubt have found quite as filled with tittle-tattle
as Madame de Sévigné’s, are in the truest sense of the
term the treasure of the humble. The finest things in
them are, like the finest things in <cite>The Task</cite>, the description
of domestic trifles. The most delightful letter
Cowper ever wrote describes a runaway rabbit. Cowper’s
eminence as a letter-writer is an invaluable illustration
of the fact that a man may be a master of
this art though his life contains nothing of excitement
or romance. The great explorers and adventurers
have seldom been good letter-writers. Macaulay
laughed at Walpole because he made a serious business
of trifles; but it is in this very fact that half the delight
of Walpole’s letters consists. Neither Walpole nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
Cowper could have written the letters he did without
that love; the one lends as much interest to crossing
the Channel as to crossing the Alps, and the other
amuses us as much with the loss of a rabbit as with the
finding of a continent. Like Biron in conversation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">His eye begets occasion for his wit;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For every object that the one doth catch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Delivers in such apt and gracious words,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That aged ears play truant at his tales,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And younger hearings are quite ravished;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So sweet and voluble is his discourse.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The display of such a wit as this is all the more
delightful in a letter because of the very intimacy of
the thing. It is not done to amuse a company, but to
delight a friend. Every true letter is a gift. If it
rises to the plane of literature, it is literature created
in honour of an individual, and is his to cherish or destroy.
It is thus the most personal and private of all
literary types, since it is the only one that can be held
to be the peculiar and exclusive property of an individual.
A lover of letters is as jealous as he is insatiable.
Like Madame du Deffand with the letters of Walpole,
he is always looking about for somebody with whom
to share his pleasures, and is for ever discovering that
no one is worthy of the honour;<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and, like her, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
passion is such that he would give the two letters that
he has for the one which he is awaiting. The secret
of such a jealous sense of ownership as this lies in the
fact that every intimate letter is really suffused with
two personalities, one of which is that of the recipient.</p>

<p>Such intimate correspondence as this was not without
an effect upon English literature. The idealization
of intimacy which made it possible spread the love of
simplicity and of a more familiar tone. The type was,
oddly enough, at one with the new romanticism in this
demand for the natural. The style in which it was
expressed is fifty years ahead of its time, and already
prophesies the more familiar tone of such men as Lamb
and Hazlitt. The following passage from Walpole is
typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every summer one lives in a state of mutiny and
murmur, and I have found the reason. It is because we
will affect to have a summer, and we have no title to
any such thing. Our poets learned their trade of the
Romans, and so adopted the terms of their masters.
They talk of shady groves, purling streams, and cooling
breezes, and we get sore throats and agues with attempting
to realize these visions. Master Damon
writes a song and invites Miss Chloe to enjoy the cool of
the evening, and the deuce a bit have we of any such
thing as a cool evening. Zephyr is a north-east wind
that makes Damon button up to the chin, and pinches
Chloe’s nose till it is red and blue; and then they cry,
‘This is a bad summer’—as if we ever had any other.
The best sun we have is made of Newcastle coal, and
I am determined never to reckon upon any other.
We ruin ourselves with inviting over foreign trees, and
make our houses clamber up hills to look at prospects.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
How our ancestors would laugh at us, who knew there
was no being comfortable unless you had a high hill
before your nose and a thick warm wood at your back!<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If the style of nineteenth century prose marks an
improvement over that of the eighteenth century in
respect of sprightliness, then surely such a passage as
this must be held to indicate the progress towards it.</p>

<p>It is amazing how wide-spread was the knowledge of
this craft. There are scores of letter-writers at the end
of the century who may be read with pleasure. Even
Mrs. Montagu could descend from the heights long
enough to write in this pleasant tone to Mrs. Garrick
and Miss More:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most engaged and engaging ladies, will you drink tea
with me on Thursday with a very small party? I
think it an age, not a golden age, since I saw you last.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With the presence of such letter-writers as Cowper,
Johnson, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and Horace
Walpole, not to mention countless minor names, it is
hardly an exaggeration to say that the familiar letter
was the chosen medium of the age, as the periodic essay
was of the earlier period and as the drama was of the
Elizabethan age. It will always remain the best
general record of the social life of the century; but its
value is more particular than this. You may read the
boisterous life of the age in its novels, you may find its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
solidity in Johnson and its superficiality in Chesterfield;
you may see its rags in Hogarth or its grace in
Reynolds; but for its simplicity, its affectionate intimacies,
and its smiling ease, you must turn to its
letters.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<span class="smcap">Fanny Burney and the Art of the Diarist</span></h3>

<p>The Diary of Fanny Burney cannot, like the conversation
of Johnson and the correspondence of Walpole,
be cited as perhaps the finest specimen of its kind.
Of the arts we are discussing, the diarist’s is the most
difficult to define or characterize; for at one extreme,
it may shrink into the dulness of a calendar, and at the
other, it may record the agonies of a soul’s attempt
to be honest with its God or with itself. Kinds so
distinct as Pepys’s <cite>Diary</cite> and the <cite>Confessions</cite> of
Rousseau seem to defy all attempts at common definition.
The Diary of Miss Burney, unlike these works,
has no psychological problems; but exists for the simple
and engaging purpose of recording events of interest.
In the beginning she resolved never to mix with her
record, her ‘religious sentiments, opinions, hopes, fears,
beliefs, or aspirations;<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> but to reserve her Diary for
worldly dross.’ If not among the greatest diaries of
the world, it is among the most normal; and it is not
impossible to define it roughly. Diaries of this kind
may be described as a sort of letter to oneself.</p>

<p>Miss Burney’s Diary was, however, written to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
read by others than herself. It was addressed to her
sisters, to whom sections of it were despatched from
time to time. It partakes, therefore, in large measure
of the nature of private correspondence, and much that
has been said of that type applies obviously to this.
But there are important differences. The greatness
of the Diary certainly does not consist in the delightful
treatment of domestic and personal trifles. Nor
does Miss Burney paint highly for the mere love of
painting, as the conversationalist and the letter-writer
often do. She is not communicating herself, but the
important life with which she is in touch. She does
not so much wish that the reader should see her, as
that he should see with her eyes—and her artistic
vision was remarkably shrewd and keen. The Diary
is thus a panorama rather than a portrait. We read
diaries either to get at the personality of the writer
or at the events described. The character of Fanny
Burney, combining sweetness, shyness, wisdom, and
pride, presents no particular problems, and is not of
commanding interest. What she saw and what she
heard, the people who loved her, who attached her to
them, and who, not unfrequently, preyed upon her—these
constitute the interest of the book; it is these
and the art with which they are set before us that make
the Diary what it is.</p>

<p>The thought that is for ever borne in upon the reader
is that Miss Burney was a very lucky woman. Suffering
as she did from shyness and an inflamed sense of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
propriety, it might easily have been her lot to lead a
life as secluded as that of her friend, Mr. Crisp of
Chessington; yet in fact Johnson himself did not
commonly associate with more people whom one would
like to have known. The young lady’s unassuming
manner was of actual value in increasing her circle of
desirable acquaintance, when once she was famous.
When once she was famous, I repeat, for most of her
interesting friends and experiences came to her as the
result of her celebrity and of the bluestocking patronage
which ensued upon it. It was Mrs. Thrale who
drew Fanny Burney into the great world which she
was to adorn and to record; but the interest of Mrs.
Thrale went out rather to the author of <cite>Evelina</cite>, than
to the mouse-like young lady of St. Martin Street.
Seldom has so timid an entry into the literary world
been accorded a reception so flattering. The young
woman who had disposed of her novel under cover of
night and anonymity, as though it had been so much
stolen goods, was presently to find that she had every
bluestocking in London at her feet, and that the King
of Letters was proclaiming her the equal of Fielding.
One speculates what would have become of her if she
had begun her career with <cite>The Wanderer</cite> instead of
<cite>Evelina</cite>. She had the luck to write her best novel—some
will say her only good novel—first; and from
that happy beginning sprang all the rest of her good
fortune.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered by those who study Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
Burney’s career that the appearance of <cite>Evelina</cite>, in 1778,
marks a definite period in the history of woman’s contribution
to English literature. Johnson’s estimate of
the book was of course ludicrously wrong, and it is well
to assume that his chivalry (for once) got the better
of his judgment; yet it is impossible to deny the superlative
significance of the book. It was the greatest
creative work that had yet been produced by an Englishwoman.
It is still read with delight by people who
never heard of Aphra Behn’s <cite>Oroonoko</cite>, Miss Fielding’s
<cite>Peter Simple</cite>, or Charlotte Lennox’s <cite>Female Quixote</cite>.
The bluestockings were right in feeling that the author
had forced a new estimate of the sex. The respect for
her work was universal: extravagant things—impossibilities—were
expected of her.</p>

<p>It was now that Miss Burney’s modesty (so carefully
nurtured) was felt to be but an added grace. The
most vicious satirist could discover in ‘little Burney’
nothing of the arrogance of a <i lang="fr">femme savante</i>. She gave
the impression of hating her talents and the fame which
had been thrust upon her. Her unassuming demeanour
and her youthful sweetness (for she was still girlish at
twenty-six) made her the delight of every drawing-room
she would consent to enter, and not unfrequently
brought down upon her admiration and social attentions
which she would have been happier without. At last,
in an unhappy hour, they brought her to the attention
of Queen Charlotte. But for the moment, all was sweetness
and triumph and popularity. Her position among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the bluestockings is noticeable; she was beloved of
them all. She was loyal to Mrs. Thrale without
sacrificing the regard of Mrs. Montagu or in any way
offending her beloved Mrs. Ord. She almost reconciled
stiff old Mrs. Delany and the dear Duchess of
Portland to literary eminence in a woman. Outside
this circle she was no less esteemed. Johnson loved
her as a daughter, and professed himself glad to ‘send
his name down to posterity’ linked with hers. Burke,
who read <cite>Evelina</cite> repeatedly, distinguished her by a
special greeting when she appeared at the trial of
Warren Hastings, as, indeed, did the prisoner himself.
Wyndham delighted to converse with her by the
hour. Walpole received her at Strawberry Hill, and
was no less pleased with her unpretentious manner
than with the fact that Mrs. Montagu now had a
superior. Had Miss Burney cared to open a salon,
she might have reigned over these men like a more
rational Lespinasse. The more her fortune is dwelt
upon, the more obvious it becomes. As a child she
had had David Garrick for a grown-up playmate;
as a young woman she had the privilege of welcoming
Sarah Siddons to the court; later in life, she conversed
on terms of intimacy with Madame de Stael. She
had passed the day in Reynolds’s studio, and had looked
at the stars through the glass of Herschel. She was
visited at Windsor by Boswell, proof-sheets in hand;
and Sheridan, at the height of his reputation, repeatedly
invited her to write a comedy. She described her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
acquaintance to Queen Charlotte as being ‘not only
very numerous, but very mixed, taking in not only
most stations in life, but also most parties.’<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> We
may marvel at the fact that the shy Fanny Burney
became a novelist; but she could hardly help becoming
a diarist.</p>

<p>Even the great misfortune of her life really contributed
to her greatness. Her life at Court, which half
killed her, a life which she repeatedly calls ‘monastic’
and describes as ‘dead and tame’—strong words from
one who thought she adored the Queen—enabled her
to depict a kind of life which, dull as it was, can never
lack significance. If for no more important reason,
her account of it will always be read as one of the great
dramas of disillusion. It furnished Macaulay with
material for one of his most brilliant extravaganzas.
Like him, we read the third and fourth volume of the
Diary, which detail that life, with feelings of rage at the
royal gaolers and at the Hanoverian ideals of conduct
that they almost succeeded in imposing upon her.
The Queen’s obvious delight in checking Miss Burney’s
literary activity and in stiffening her sense of propriety
(which needed no stiffening) makes it difficult to control
the judgment; and yet, upon reflection, it will be seen
that the reader’s rage is but a tribute to one of the
most effective pieces of realism in the language. It is
true that it is often dull, but so is realism. It is true
that Miss Burney’s adulation of the Royal Family is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
at times painfully fulsome; but even this only heightens
the description of that life which, despite all adulation,
she found unendurable. The story of her captivity is
no less thrilling than that of Pamela in the clutches of
Mrs. Jewkes.</p>

<p>As a delineation of an ogress, Mrs. Schwellenberg
is at once more horrible and more lifelike than Mrs.
Jewkes; beside her, all the ‘weatherbeaten old she-dragons’
of eighteenth century fiction and drama pale
into insignificance. Miss Burney has often been praised
for creating the character of Madame Duval, but that
lady is a mere commonplace when compared with the
spiteful old crone who had no interest above piquet and
who divided the slight remnant of affection of which
her withered nature was capable between her royal
owner and her tame frogs. Her ambitions for Fanny
Burney, the idol of the blues, was that she should
learn piquet, give up writing, and become like unto
herself, a spaniel of the backstairs. Few characters in
literature are at once so comic and so loathsome.</p>

<p>It might be assumed that the depiction of Mrs.
Schwellenberg were the result of mere dislike, if Miss
Burney had not, at the same moment, been proving
by her portrayal of Queen Charlotte that her vision
was never more keen and her judgment of character
never more unbiassed. She had no intention whatever
of analyzing her mistress. As a lover of royal families,
she was far more prone to idealize her; but for all
that she had a genius for truthfulness, and could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
help mirroring the royal nature with a fatal accuracy.
It is the revelation of such royalty as can conceive no
happiness apart from its own presence, of a queenly
etiquette in which a native sweetness is lost in acquired
selfishness. For subtlety and moderation this characterization
is unsurpassed in its own century, and not
often equalled in the century that followed it, for all
its psychology and realism.</p>

<p>The triumph of Miss Burney’s realism over her
personal inclination may be illustrated by setting side
by side two sentences drawn from the same entry in
the Diary for December 1790: ‘Her Majesty was very
kind during this time, and the Princesses interested
themselves about me with a sweetness very grateful
to me.’ This is the expression of what is proper from
the Keeper of the Robes; but on the next page it
shrivels away before her sense of actuality: ‘Though
I was frequently so ill in her presence that I could
scarcely stand, I saw she concluded me, while life
remained, inevitably hers.’</p>

<p>These court-episodes in the Diary of Miss Burney
are of special use in showing her powers of characterization.
The earlier sections of the book deal with
people no less interesting, but so familiar to us from
other sources that Miss Burney’s skill in depicting
them is not so readily perceived. No particular surprise
mingles with our pleasure as we read of Johnson
and of Mrs. Thrale, of Reynolds and of Mrs. Montagu,
because the author’s art seems but to reflect, at most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
to amplify, what we have seen elsewhere. It is when
she has occasion to make us acquainted with persons
whom we have not met elsewhere, with ‘Mr. Turbulent’
and Mrs. Schwellenberg, that we begin to perceive
the extent of her powers. Her five years’ imprisonment
in no way impairs her observation of human
nature. The sudden apparition of James Boswell upon
the scene is as captivating a piece of writing as anything
in the whole Diary; the contrast between his
cheerful officiousness and the blundering officiousness
of Mr. Turbulent is a sufficient proof of the fact that
Miss Burney has retained all her old skill in characterization.
Nor has the sense for a boisterous scene
departed from the author of <cite>Evelina</cite>. The quiet little
lady with prim demeanour still had a love of broad
comedy, as the following pages may show. The scene
is Mrs. Schwellenberg’s table, the occasion a dinner of
the royal attendants in honour of the King’s birthday,
the chief actor the Duke of Clarence (afterwards William
IV), the Royal Sailor, who is shown, to use Miss
Burney’s words—and they are significant of her conscious
art—‘in genuine colours.’</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Champagne being now brought for the Duke, he
ordered it all round. When it came to me, I whispered
to Westerhaults [the footman] to carry it on: the Duke
slapped his hand violently on the table, and called out,
‘Oh ——, you shall drink it!’</p>

<p>There was no resisting this. We all stood up, and
the Duke sonorously gave the Royal toast.</p>

<p>‘And now,’ cried he, making us all sit down again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
‘where are my rascals of servants? I sha’n’t be in time
for the ball; besides, I’ve got a —— tailor waiting to fix
on my epaulette! Here, you, go and see for my servants!
d’ye hear? Scamper off!’</p>

<p>Off ran William.</p>

<p>‘Come, let’s have the King’s health again. De Luc,
drink it. Here, Champagne to De Luc!’</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen Mr. De Luc’s mixed
simper—half pleased, half alarmed. However, the
wine came and he drank it, the Duke taking a bumper
for himself at the same time.</p>

<p>‘Poor Stanhope!’ cried he: ‘Stanhope shall have a
glass too! Here, Champagne! What are you all
about? Why don’t you give Champagne to poor
Stanhope?’</p>

<p>Mr. Stanhope, with great pleasure, complied, and
the Duke again accompanied him.</p>

<p>‘Come hither, do you hear?’ cried the Duke to the
servants, and on the approach, slow and submissive,
of Mrs. Stainforth’s man, he hit him a violent slap
on the back, calling out ‘Hang you! Why don’t
you see for my rascals?’</p>

<p>Away flew the man, and then he called out to Westerhaults,
‘Hark’ee! bring another glass of Champagne
to Mr. De Luc!’</p>

<p>Mr. De Luc knows these Royal youths too well to
venture at so vain an experiment as disputing with
them; so he only shrugged his shoulders and drank the
wine. The Duke did the same.</p>

<p>‘And now, poor Stanhope,’ cried the Duke, ‘give
another to poor Stanhope, d’ye hear?’</p>

<p>‘Is not your Royal Highness afraid,’ cried Mr.
Stanhope, displaying the full circle of his borrowed
teeth, ‘I shall be apt to be rather up in the world, as
the folks say, if I tope on at this rate?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all! you can’t get drunk in a better cause.
I’d get drunk myself if it was not for the ball. Here,
Champagne! another glass for the philosopher! I
keep sober for Mary.’...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>He then said it was necessary to drink the Queen’s
health.</p>

<p>The gentlemen here made no demur, though Mr.
De Luc arched his eyebrows in expressive fear of consequences.</p>

<p>‘A bumper,’ cried the Duke, ‘to the Queen’s gentleman-usher.’</p>

<p>They all stood up and drank the Queen’s health.</p>

<p>‘Here are three of us,’ cried the Duke, ‘all belonging
to the Queen: the Queen’s philosopher, the Queen’s
gentleman-usher, and the Queen’s son; but, thank
Heaven, I’m nearest!’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ cried Mr. Stanhope, a little affronted, ‘I am
not now the Queen’s gentleman-usher; I am the Queen’s
equerry, sir.’</p>

<p>‘A glass more of Champagne here! What are you all
so slow for? Where are all my rascals gone? They’ve
put me in one passion already this morning. Come, a
glass of Champagne for the Queen’s gentleman-usher!’
laughing heartily.</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ repeated Mr. Stanhope, ‘I am equerry now!’</p>

<p>‘And another glass to the Queen’s philosopher!’</p>

<p>Neither gentleman objected; but Mrs. <ins class="corr" id="tn-264" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Schwellburg, who'">
Schwellenberg, who</ins> had sat laughing and happy all this time,
now grew alarmed, and said, ‘Your Royal Highness, I
am afraid for the ball!’</p>

<p>‘Hold your potato-jaw, my dear,’ cried the Duke,
patting her; but recollecting himself, he took her hand
and pretty abruptly kissed it, and then, flinging it
hastily away, laughed aloud, and called out, ‘There!
that will make amends for anything, so now I may say
what I will. So here! a glass of Champagne for the
Queen’s philosopher and the Queen’s gentleman-usher!
Hang me if it will not do them a monstrous deal of
good!’</p>

<p>Here news was brought that the equipage was in
order. He started up, calling out, ‘Now, then, for
my —— tailor.’<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>Scenes as vivid, though not so uproarious, might
be cited in every chapter of the work; to quote them
all would be to print half the Diary. The selection here
given is sufficient to show why Miss Burney’s writing is
invariably referred to as dramatic. The Diary is, in
parts, so like a novel as to prompt the query whether
it is at all reliable as a record of facts. Did not the
author’s imagination play freely over the events?
Did she not select, arrange, and colour according to
the demands of art rather than of history? Are the
conversations not improved? Is not the diarist a
novelist still? Questions of this large kind can hardly
be answered save in a large, impressionistic way. The
Diary is, in general, a truthful document and a reliable
account of the life which it records. A mere glance
at the book will reveal the fact that Miss Burney had
little of Boswell’s passion for literalness, for accurate
dates, and for written evidence. But Boswell was
unique in his generation, and Boswell was a lawyer.
Miss Burney was writing to amuse her sisters, not to
inform the public; but there are passages which show
that she was endowed with a remarkably accurate
memory. She once has occasion<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> to quote a letter
from memory; a comparison of it with the original,
which happens to be in existence, reveals no evidence of
misinterpretation, and shows the copy to be, in fact,
very nearly a literal reproduction of the original.
We are to remember that Miss Burney had been in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
habit of keeping a diary, recording conversations which
had interested her, ever since the age of fifteen; and
that this had strengthened her memory as well as her
powers of observation. It was to a similar practice
that Boswell owed his ability to record conversation
with accuracy; and he himself asserted that the ability
grew with practice. There is no reason for supposing
that the results in one case were radically different
from those in the other. Certain it is that Miss Burney’s
record of Johnson’s conversation is in no way
inconsistent with Boswell’s. To say that in describing
life at Streatham or at the Court she used her skill in
selection and that she employed the judgment of a
novelist in beginning and ending a conversation effectively
is merely to repeat that the Diary is a work of
art. Judgment in the choice of facts to set down need
not indicate a misinterpretation of them.</p>

<p>There is but one quality in Miss Burney which shakes
the reader’s confidence in her judgment of character.
There is a tendency to emotionalism in her which the
irreverent will term gush. She was touched with the
sentimentality of her times. The tear of sensibility
is ever trembling in her eyes. Her affection for Mrs.
Thrale, Mrs. Locke, Mrs. Delany, and most other ladies,
for ‘dear Daddy Crisp,’ for ‘dear Sir Joshua,’ is so
effusive as to make all terms of endearment seem
tawdry.</p>

<p>Hardly less distressing than this mawkishness is the
lady’s self-consciousness, which she mistook for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
virtue of modesty. The flattery which brought the
blush of shame to her cheek and kept her on the verge
of swooning, the flattery which made her shrink into
corners or retire in confusion from the scene, the praise
which was too gross for her ears, all this is written
down <i lang="it">in extenso</i> and with something unpleasantly
like gusto. It flows through the Diary like an apocalyptic
river of honey. Macaulay reminds us, quite
properly, that all this was ‘for the eyes of two or three
persons who had loved her from infancy, who had loved
her in obscurity, and to whom her fame gave the purest
and most exquisite delight.’ This is true, no doubt;
but might not father and sisters have achieved delight
without this surfeit of sweetness, ‘whereof a little more
than a little is by much too much’? It is all very
human, of course, and it would be chivalrous to forget
it. But all the chivalry in the world cannot hide the
fact that it is a serious blot on the art of the Diary, a
blot that we cannot but wish away from so splendid a
work.</p>

<span class="smcap">Boswell and the Art of Intimate Biography</span></h3>

<p>It is the privilege of few men in any age to raise
an art to such perfection that it becomes in effect a new
thing. The development of intimate biography is still
largely the work of one man. After a hundred years of
memorabilia, personal reminiscences, and interviews,
Boswell is still as indubitably the greatest of biographers
as when he referred to his book as the ‘first in the
world,’ or when, fifty years later, Macaulay applied
to him the language of the race-course, and pronounced,
‘Eclipse is first, and the rest nowhere.’ Later biographers
do not eclipse him, nor do earlier ones explain
him. A comparison of his work with what went before
serves only to reveal his utter uniqueness. If an earlier
biographer suggests a point of comparison in his realistic
record of conversation, the slightness of his work
gives no conception of the whole life he is writing;
if another seems like Boswell in refusing to write a mere
eulogy, he seems chill and judicial where Boswell is
warm with pulsing life. Other lives give us admirable
things: table-talk, a portrait, a eulogy, a handful of
anecdotes, a list of dates from ‘pedigree to funeral,’
or a volume of letters; but Boswell gives us all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
and more. He aspires to be as complete as life itself.
Boswell knew and delighted in other biographies; but
was hardly influenced by them. He knew Plutarch,
Xenophon, and Valerius Maximus, among the ancients,
and Jonson’s <cite>Timber</cite>, Selden’s <cite>Table-Talk</cite>, and Spence’s
<cite>Anecdotes</cite>, among modern <em>ana</em>; but is like none of these.
He surpasses them all in intimacy, variety, and what,
for want of a better name, may be called his sustained
quality. To read Boswell after these men is like
passing to a Flemish painting from a study in black and
white.</p>

</figure>

<p>In so far as he can be said to have learned his art
from any man, his master was Johnson himself. The
first sentence in the <cite>Life</cite> proclaims Johnson’s superiority
to all men in writing the lives of others. Biography was
often discussed by the two men together, and Boswell
was also well acquainted with Johnson’s published
remarks on the subject. Johnson enunciated, with fair
consistency, the theory of intimate biography, but he
never fully realized it in any work of his. Thus he
was wont to assert that autobiography was superior to
biography, for the simple reason that a man might
more readily reveal the facts concerning himself. If
a man’s life is to be written by another than himself,
it should be by one who has ‘eat and drunk and lived in
social intercourse with him.’ The material of biography,
he asserts, at various times, to be ‘trifles,’ the
‘delicate features of the mind,’ the ‘minute peculiarities
of conduct,’ ‘domestic privacies,’ and ‘the minute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
details of daily life.’ He approved of much anecdote in
biography, used such incidents with a free hand in his
own work, and encouraged Boswell to record them.
He did not, however, anywhere fully embody his
theories. It was, in truth, impossible for him to do so
in the <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>, for, with the exception of
Savage, he had been on terms of real intimacy with
none of these men. Had he written the life of Goldsmith,
as he once thought of doing, he might, if his
indolence had not prevented him, have produced such a
book as would illustrate his own theories. Yet, in
spite of this lack of intimacy in the <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>,
he was attacked for making them too familiar. Potter,
Mrs. Montagu’s <i lang="fr">protégé</i>, denounced his introduction
of trifles into serious biography, considering it beneath
the dignity of that art to mention that Pope wore three
pairs of stockings to increase the size of his legs, and
that he loved to feast on potted lampreys which he
heated in a silver saucepan. ‘We know,’ writes the
critic, ‘that the greatest men are subject to the infirmities
of human nature equally with the meanest;
why then are these infirmities recorded?’</p>

<p>This sentence may be taken to summarize the general
conception of biography before Boswell. The death
of a man seems to have been regarded as an opportunity
for rationalizing his views and perfecting his character.
The duty of a biographer was to forget all vices and to
idealize all virtues, with the laudable purpose of setting
before the public a notable pattern of conduct. ‘He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
that writes the life of another,’ wrote Johnson in the
<cite>Idler</cite>, ‘endeavours to hide the man that he may produce
a hero.’ Even Johnson never felt quite sure how far
it was proper to describe a man’s vices in writing
his biography. Boswell notes the inconsistency of
his views. When the subject of the poet Parnell’s
drinking arose, Johnson remarked, ‘More ill may be
done by the example, than good by telling the whole
truth’; but at another time he said, ‘If a man is to
write <cite>A Panegyric</cite>, he may keep vices out of sight;
but if he professes to write <cite>A Life</cite>, he must represent
it really as it was.... It would produce an instructive
caution to avoid drinking, when it was seen that even
the learning and genius of Parnell could be debased by
it.’<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> In practice it is clear that Johnson preferred to
err on the side of frankness. Potter was shocked because
he revealed the avidity of Addison by repeating
the now-hackneyed story of how Steele was forced to
pay a debt of £100. If biography is regarded as the
handmaid of morality, and eulogy is preferred to
actuality, such details are of course worse than useless.
Beattie dwells on ‘the due distinction between what
deserves to be known and what ought to be forgotten.’<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
Miss Burney considered that the publication of letters
verbatim was the ‘greatest injury’ to a man’s memory.
Horace Walpole, who deplored the whole policy of
expurgation, nevertheless gives Mason, the biographer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
of Gray, the conventional advice. He avows that the
publication of the life of Gray is an opportunity to
establish that poet’s character ‘unimpeached.’ He was
shocked at the section of the biography which Mason
had submitted to his criticism, because it was honest
and frank. ‘What can provoke you to be so imprudent?... You
know my idea was that your work
should consecrate his name.’<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Once such a theory of
consecration is adopted, the author of a life is driven
relentlessly towards panegyric; for, not daring to
trust the public to interpret facts, he must suppress
everything that is not admirable, lest the mention of
even the slightest fault be taken to point to the existence
of thousands that are passed over in silence.
When once you have taken to varnishing, you must
varnish thoroughly, for any cracks or bare spots
which reveal the material beneath ruin your whole
effect.</p>

<p>To a public with these lofty notions of propriety
Boswell, genially sacrificing what little was left to
him of his reputation, addressed, in 1785, his <cite>Journal
of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson</cite> ... ‘containing ... A
series of his Conversation, Literary
Anecdotes and Opinions of Men and Books.’ It
was a jumble of gossip such as readers had hitherto
seen only in the twopenny pamphlets of the scandal-mongers
of Grub Street; but was set forth with an
abundance of detail which captured the most frivolous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and an air of authenticity which convinced the most
sceptical. It depicted a great man who had been in his
grave but a few months. It was written with veneration,
but wholly without awe, as though a valet had
collaborated with the Recording Angel. It flouted all
restraints, and passed the most distant limits of decency.
Nothing like it had ever been heard of. Even in our
own day, to a world whose nerves have been jaded by a
thousand <i lang="fr">exposés</i>, such a book would come as a surprise,
but to the world of 1786 it was a revelation of
new possibilities in literature, as alarming as they
were entertaining. With all the frankness of Pepys
the author combines the conscious skill of one who has
mastered the art of anecdote and the joy of a conceited
man who realizes that he is about to attain fame by
one of the by-paths of literature. It was difficult, in
1785, to say whether Johnson’s theory of familiar
biography had been realized or travestied in this book.
It was obvious that he had been hoist with his own
petard. The world was informed with the most
scrupulous accuracy of how he said his prayers and how
he was persuaded to wear a woollen night-cap. His
idlest word was recorded as though in a dictograph.
‘I have often thought that if I kept a seraglio, the ladies
should all wear linen gowns,—or cotton; I mean
stuffs made of vegetable substances. I would have no
silk; you cannot tell when it is clean, ...’ and so
forth. At times the book is hardly quotable. Once
when about to get into a dirty bed, during their travels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
in the Hebrides, Boswell remarks: ‘We had much hesitation,
whether to undress, or lye down with our
clothes on. I said at last, “I’ll plunge in! There will
be less harbour for vermin about me when I’m stripped”—Dr.
Johnson said, he was like one hesitating to go
into the cold bath. At last he resolved too.’ The
first sensation of the reader of such amazing stuff as
this is that Boswell was engaged in a deliberate
attempt to degrade a great man. He was accused by
a writer in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite><a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> of having
‘exposed and cut up’ his hero ‘in the most shameful
and cruel manner.’ That Boswell had a kind of mischievous
delight in what he was doing, no one need
take the trouble to tell us; but that he was a sort of
skilful blackmailer is now unthinkable. He felt that
he was doing the world a service in showing that a great
man was human; and time has proved that he was
right. ‘There is something noble,’ Johnson had remarked
to him, ‘in publishing truth, though it condemns
one’s self.’ Boswell paid this price. He made
Johnson permanently familiar by making himself
almost permanently notorious. Witness the following
extract:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Johnson went to bed soon. When one bowl
of punch was finished, I rose, and was near the door,
in my way up stairs to bed; but Corrichatachin said,
it was the first time Col had been in his house, and he
should have his bowl—and would not I join in drinking
it? The heartiness of my honest landlord, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
desire of doing social honour to our very obliging conductor,
induced me to sit down again. Col’s bowl was
finished; and by that time we were well warmed. A
third bowl was soon made, and that too was finished.
We were cordial, and merry to a high degree; but of
what passed I have no recollection, with any accuracy.
I remember calling <em>Corrichatachin</em> by the familiar
appellation of <em>Corri</em>, which his friends do. A fourth
bowl was made, by which time Col, and young M’Kinnon,
Corrichatachin’s son, slipped away to bed. I
continued a little with Corri and Knockow; but at last
I left them. It was near five in the morning when I
got to bed.</p>


<p class="center">Sunday, September 26.</p>

<p>I awaked at noon, with a severe head-ach. I was
much vexed that I should have been guilty of such a
riot, and afraid of a reproof from Dr. Johnson. I
thought it very inconsistent with that conduct which I
ought to maintain, while the companion of the Rambler.
About one he came into my room, and accosted me,
‘What, drunk yet?’ His tone of voice was not that of
severe upbraiding; so I was relieved a little. ‘Sir,
(said I,) they kept me up.’ He answered, ‘No, you
kept them up, you drunken dog:’—This he said with
good-humoured <em>English</em> pleasantry. Soon afterwards,
Corrichatachin, Col, and other friends assembled round
my bed. Corri had a brandy-bottle and glass with
him, and insisted I should take a dram. ‘Ay, said Dr.
Johnson, fill him drunk again. Do it in the morning,
that we may laugh at him all day. It is a poor thing
for a fellow to get drunk at night, and sculk to bed, and
let his friends have no sport.’ Finding him thus jocular,
I became quite easy; and when I offered to get up,
he very good naturedly said, ‘You need be in no such
hurry now.’ I took my host’s advice, and drank some
brandy, which I found an effectual cure for my head-ach.
When I rose, I went into Dr. Johnson’s room,
and taking up Mrs. M’Kinnon’s Prayer-book, I opened
it at the twentieth Sunday after Trinity, in the epistle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
for which I read, ‘And be not drunk with wine, wherein
there is excess.’ Some would have taken this as a
divine interposition.</p>
</div>

<p>Such writing as this at once divided the reading public
into hostile camps. There were many who considered
the book delightful; others considered it a new
kind of libel. It became the subject of a long controversy
in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>. In the December
following its appearance, Boswell was accused of ‘betraying
private conversations even of the most trivial
kind.’ In May, the tastes of a ‘gossiping age’ were
denounced as well. By December 1786, the sale of
the book having gone triumphantly forward, Boswell
was reminded that his popularity was due solely to the
general interest in Johnson; the sale of his work was
compared to the consumption of potatoes in a time of
famine; and the public was instructed that such works
require for their composition nothing but an ear and a
memory.</p>

<p>In the spring of the same year, soon after the appearance
of Mrs. Piozzi’s <cite>Anecdotes</cite>, Walpole wrote to
Mann:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She and Boswell and their hero are the joke of the
public. A Dr. Wolcot, <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> Peter Pindar, has
published a burlesque eclogue,<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> in which Boswell and
the signora are the interlocutors, and all the absurdest
passages in the works of both are ridiculed. The print-shops
teem with satiric prints on them: one, in which
Boswell, as a monkey, is riding on Johnson, the bear,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
has this witty inscription, ‘My friend <i lang="la">delineavit</i>.’—But
enough of these mountebanks!<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Other caricatures represented the ghost of Johnson
haunting Boswell while he pieced together his <cite>Journal</cite>
from various rags of reminiscence, and the bust of
Johnson frowning down upon Boswell and Mrs. Piozzi
as they wrote. Rowlandson and Collings later made
the <cite>Tour</cite> the subject of a series of sixteen caricatures.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_276fp" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_276fp.jpg" alt="Caricature of Boswell and Johnson’s ghost">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Boswell Haunted by the Ghost of Johnson</span><br>
From a contemporary caricature</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In 1786, moreover, a pamphlet appeared entitled,
<cite>A Poetical Epistle from the Ghost of Dr. Johnson to his
Friends</cite>, in which Boswell was satirized together with
Strahan, Courtenay, and Mrs. Piozzi. The verses were
elaborately annotated with quotations from the <cite>Journal</cite>,
and Boswell was addressed by the manes of Johnson in
these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">How oft I mark’d thee, like a watchful cat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">List’ning to catch up all my silly chat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How oft that chat I still more silly made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see it in thy commonplace conveyed.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was the invariable charge against the book. It
was a mass of small talk collected by a man with a
retentive memory, ‘not to do honour to his [Johnson’s]
memory, by judiciously selecting the best and most
striking of his sentences, but with a design to show his
own assiduity in exhibiting the Doctor in the most
glaring colours of inconsistency.’<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>There was a secondary charge against the book. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
was conceived as a libel on living people.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Various
persons—the Duchess of Hamilton, Sir Alexander
MacDonald, and many of those who had entertained
the travellers in the Hebrides—discovered in the
book remarks about themselves that were anything
but palatable. A reference to Mrs. Thrale created the
greatest excitement. Johnson’s remark that she could
not get through Mrs. Montagu’s <cite>Essay on Shakespeare</cite>
was there for all the world to read. She protested in
her <cite>Anecdotes</cite>; but Boswell reminded her, in the pages
of the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, that she had read his
<cite>Journal</cite> in manuscript, without complaining of this,
and that he was but quoting Johnson’s own words
regarding her. So ended one controversy. It was
not the only one.</p>

<p>But perhaps the chief excitement rose from the
advertisement at the end of the volume, in which Boswell
announced that he had but begun his memoirs of
Johnson. He proposed presently to ‘erect a literary
monument worthy of so great an author,’ and stated
that he had been collecting biographical material for
more than twenty years. The promise, for those who
had known Johnson, was not gratifying. If Boswell
had upset the literary world with an account of three
months in Johnson’s life, what would he do in recounting
seventy-five years of it? Everybody who had
known Johnson held his breath for fear. Many urged
the new biographer to be cautious. Fanny Burney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
refused to assist him in his work of showing the pleasanter
side of Johnson’s character, and wrote in her
Diary,<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> ‘I feel sorry to be named or remembered by
that biographical, anecdotical memorandummer till
his book of poor Dr. Johnson’s life is finished and published.’
Sir William Forbes, who was distressed
because Boswell had quoted his approval of the <cite>Journal</cite>,
took the liberty of ‘strongly enjoining him’ to be more
careful about personalities in the later work.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> He had
perhaps never heard Boswell’s famous reply to Hannah
More, who had urged him to ‘mitigate some of Johnson’s
asperities’ when he published the <cite>Journal</cite>. ‘He
said roughly,’ she writes, ‘“He would not cut off his
claws, nor make a tiger a cat to please anybody.”’<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
This remark has been hackneyed in every work on
Boswell, but it can never be quoted too often, for it is
Boswell’s reply to the world. There is nothing more
to be said.</p>

<p>I have dwelt on the reception of Boswell’s <cite>Journal
of a Tour to the Hebrides</cite> because it is the most effective
way of showing the novelty and the magnitude of his
achievement. If the author had been any other than
James Boswell, critics would long ere this have expatiated
on the splendid courage of his undertaking;
but he enjoyed and esteemed his own work too highly
to elicit such praise. Whatever were Boswell’s superficial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
faults, whatever the resentments that he caused,
it is impossible to withhold our admiration from the
simple confidence in the letter of the truth that characterized
his Scotch soul. His would be the simplicity
of childhood if it were not the simplicity of genius.
The Lord Bishop of Chester complained<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> that Boswell
recorded facts simply because they were facts. Such
was indeed the case.</p>

<p>When, in 1791, the <cite>Life</cite> appeared, many of the old
charges were repeated and some of the old satires
revived; but it is not important to consider them in
detail, for the note of admiration, which had been
heard now and again in the beginning, when the <cite>Journal</cite>
was published, soon became dominant. The other
lives and memoirs of Johnson, with which Boswell’s
former work had often been compared, now served
only for purposes of contrast; they were useful in
illustrating the greatness of the new work.</p>

<p>What are the characteristics which tended to give
the <cite>Life</cite> its place in the history of biography? They
are of the simplest kind. Boswell had, as this entire
chapter has been designed to show, a passion for completeness.
It is hardly necessary to labour this point.
Boswell himself writes near the opening of his book:
‘I will venture to say that he will be seen in this work
more completely than any man who has yet lived.’
In this sentence Boswell wrote his own panegyric, as in
his reply to Miss More he had pronounced his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
defence. Like everything that he did, the panegyric
is not without the ludicrous touch, for he adds: ‘Had
his other friends been as diligent and ardent as I was,
he might have been almost entirely preserved.’ He
might, indeed; for why should anything be lost, while
there is a note-book—and a Boswell? Boswell, I
repeat, aspired to the completeness of life itself.</p>

<p>Nor is it greatly necessary to dwell on Boswell’s
fidelity to fact. It has been often dwelt upon, and,
through the labours of Dr. Birkbeck Hill, is now generally
admitted; though by one who liked neither Boswell
nor Hill the matter has recently been once more called
in question.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> It would seem that a work which in its
own day was both praised and denounced for its
scrupulous accuracy might have been accepted without
question. It is scarcely reasonable to demand a more
lifelike biographer than Boswell. His own times
readily granted that he had given the true Johnson;
that was both the praise and the blame. Pepys, who
knew Johnson and had no illusions about him, wrote
to Hannah More:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Journal is a most faithful picture of him, so
faithful that I think anybody who has got a clear idea
of his person and manner may know as much of him
from that book as by having been acquainted with
him (in the usual way) for three years.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">This was written before the <cite>Life</cite> appeared. Respecting
the later work we have the testimony of Burke to
its value as a monument to Johnson’s conversation.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
Even more than this may be said. We have the
nearest possible thing to Johnson’s own approval.
He had himself read the <cite>Journal</cite> in manuscript, and
pronounced it a ‘very exact picture of a portion of his
life.’ It is difficult to demand more than this. In the
same work Boswell writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He read this day a good deal of my <cite>Journal</cite>, written
in a small book with which he had supplied me, and
was pleased, for he said, ‘I wish thy books were twice
as big.’ He helped me fill up blanks which I had left in
first writing it, when I was not quite sure of what he
had said, and he corrected any mistakes that I had
made.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In his accurate reproduction of life, Boswell surpasses
all the realists and attains to something of the inexhaustibility
of nature itself. Delightful as is his book
for mere reading, it can never be fully appreciated till
it has been used as a work of reference; for such it was
intended to be. The work exhibits, according to the
title-page, ‘a view of literature and literary men in
Great Britain for near half a century.’ Boswell
aspired to be not only stenographer but historian.
And to the life that he loved he was both.</p>

<p>We reach at last the core of Boswell’s being, his
pagan joy in life, that greediness of social pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
which explains all his faults and suggests all his greatness.
He loved social life as other men have loved a
noble woman or a noble cause. He solemnly dedicated
his life to it and his genius to the recording of it. Only
when his work is viewed in the large does one see its
grandeur. Like Ulysses, he might have said, when his
great work was done, ‘Much have I seen and known,
cities of men and manners ... myself not least but
honoured of them all.’</p>

<p>I incline to think that this social avidity is the
ruling passion not only of Boswell but of all the life
that we have been studying, of the salons, the conversationists,
the diarists, and the letter-writers. That life
at its best blends two kinds of pleasure that seem ordinarily
incompatible, those of society and solitude, of
association and reflection. In the ‘exchange of mind’
which is its ideal, its disciples find a joy that excels the
more passive pleasures of reading, by bringing them
directly into the creation of its characteristic product,
conversation, and to this it adds the pleasure of seeing
the immediate effect of one’s words. Conversation
such as this may be said to represent the active, social,
and more human side of the intellectual life, while
meditation stands for its contemplative and eremitical
side. The two are often mutually exclusive. Philosopher
and poet belong to the latter class, because the
meditative temper naturally shuns social distractions;
but diarists, letter-writers, and biographers owe their
very existence to this social instinct, and write to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
exalt it. They cannot bear that the delights which
they have experienced should pass away without leaving
a memorial. They are determined not only to pluck
the passing hour, but to do what they can to preserve
the blossom even as it droops in their hand. A withered
flower is better than none at all; at worst, it is a
pathetic reminder of what has been. The memorialist
is one whose face is ever towards the past and the
glories that have been, the <i lang="la">noctes cæncæque deum</i>. It
is in honour of them that his work is done. His office
is to record life, not to transfigure it. He cannot
aspire to be among those who have seen visions and
pointed others towards them; the joy of poetic creation
and the passion of adventurous thought are not for
him; but it is his to know men and the cheerful ways
of men, and to unite us with the heroic minds of old,
not in the lonely glory of their visions, but in their
more familiar hours and their more human joys.</p>

all his round features squeezed themselves into sharp angles; he screwed up
his button-mouth and [rapped] his snuff-box.... I well knew his vanity,
even about his ridiculous face and person, but thought he had too much
sense to avow it so palpably.’ <cite>Letters</cite> 11. 376; 27 January 1781. Gibbon

<p><a id="Footnote_181" href="#FNanchor_181" class="label">[181]</a> Hannah More’s piquant description of an assembly is worth quoting
in full:</p>

<p>‘On Monday I was at a very great assembly at the Bishop of Saint
Asaph’s. Conceive to yourself one hundred and fifty or two hundred people
met together, dressed in the extremity of the fashion; painted as red as
bacchanals; poisoning the air with perfumes; treading on each other’s
gowns; making the crowd they blame; not one in ten able to get a chair;
protesting they are engaged to ten other places; and lamenting the fatigue
they are not obliged to endure; ten or a dozen card-tables, crammed with
dowagers of quality, grave ecclesiastics, and yellow admirals; and you have
an idea of an assembly.’ Roberts’ <cite>Memoirs of More</cite> 1. 242; cf. <em>ib.</em> 1. 311.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_182" href="#FNanchor_182" class="label">[182]</a> Other contemporary descriptions of the salon will be found elsewhere in

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> This was an important matter with some of the bluestockings, as the
following quotation from Hannah More may show: ‘I never knew a great
party turn out so pleasantly as the other night at the Pepys’s. There was
all the pride of London—every wit and every wit-ess ... but the spirit
of the evening was kept up on the strength of a little lemonade till past
eleven, without cards, scandal, or politics.’ Roberts’ <cite>Memoirs of More</cite> 1. 208.</p>

<p>Johnson’s opposition to anything of the sort is shown by his remark on
‘an evening society for conversation’: ‘There is nothing served about there,
neither tea, nor coffee, nor lemonade, nor anything whatever, and depend
upon it, Sir, a man does not love to go to a place from whence he comes out
exactly as he went in.’ Boswell’s <cite>Life</cite> 4. 90.</p>

sweetmeats.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="label">[185]</a> How true this is to the spirit of conversation is shown by a somewhat
scandalous discussion of Miss Hannah More which passed between Mrs.
Cholmondeley and Miss Burney: Mrs. Cholmondeley: ‘I don’t like her
at all; that is, I detest her! She does nothing but flatter and fawn; and
then she thinks ill of nobody. Don’t you hate a person who thinks ill of
nobody?’ <cite>Diary of Mme. D’Arblay</cite> 1. 188.</p>

cited (notably in the <cite>New English Dictionary</cite> and in Hill’s edition of Boswell’s
<cite>Life of Johnson</cite>) as showing that the term <em>bluestocking</em> was in use as early as
March 8, 1757, on which day Mrs. Montagu writes: ‘I assure you our philosopher
(Mr. Stillingfleet) is so much a man of pleasure, he has left off his old
friends and his blue stockings, and is at operas and other gay assemblies
every night.’ Personally I do not think that this can be regarded as an
occurrence of the word <em>bluestocking</em> at all. I incline to think that Mrs.
Montagu means no more than she literally says, that Mr. Stillingfleet has
left off the homely garb for which he was noted. But, in any case, it is
interesting as a reference to the fame of his stockings, and tends to support
Boswell’s explanation of the term.</p>

intolerably loud, peremptory, and insolent; and you could imagine that he
alone was the Monarch and legislator of the World.’ Walpole, who met him
at Baron d’Holbach’s, was so bored by his questions that he pretended to be
deaf. ‘After dinner he found I was not, and never forgave me.’ Three
years later, however, he dined with Walpole at Strawberry Hill: ‘The Abbé
Raynal not only looked at nothing himself, but kept talking to the Ambassador
the whole time, and would not let him see anything neither. There
never was such an impertinent and tiresome old gossip. He said to one of
the Frenchmen, we ought to come abroad to make us love our own country.
This was before Mr. Churchill, who replied very properly, “Yes we had
some Esquimaux here lately, and they liked nothing because they could get
no train-oil for breakfast.”’ <cite>Letters</cite> 9. 92; 12 November 1774, and 10. 62;

me, they are all stifled in the cradle; for he must know who I am before he

were of great use to Johnson, as he himself remarks (<cite>Lives</cite> 1. xxvii, ed. Hill).
Boswell regrets (<cite>Life</cite> 4. 63) that Johnson did not make a more handsome
acknowledgment; but Boswell seems to have been unaware of Mrs. Boscawen’s
connection with the whole transaction. Mrs. Boscawen cannot be

this. Young’s dreary ode, <cite>Resignation</cite>, was addressed to her, on the death
of Admiral Boscawen; Mrs. Montagu had taken the widow to the ancient
poet for consolation. In this poem she is bidden to ‘go forth a moral Amazon,
armed with undaunted thought.’ Perhaps the last of these poetical tributes
was a sonnet (from which a selection is here printed for the first time), by
Pye when poet laureate. Writing of her villa at Richmond, once the home
of Thomson, the poet Pye says:</p>

writes (Roberts’s <cite>Memoirs of More</cite> 2. 35), ‘is worthy of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
superior skill; but I can command Opie, and make him alter, or even refaire
if we do not like it.’ In her reply, Miss More stated that nothing could
overcome her natural repugnance to having her portrait taken, but Mrs.
Boscawen’s wishes which are to her ‘such indisputable commands.’ The
portrait, which was hung in Mrs. Boscawen’s dining-room, became so popular
that both Walpole and Mrs. Walsingham wished copies of it.</p>

<p class="noindent fs150">English Drama of the Restoration and<br>
Eighteenth Century (1642-1780)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#160; By</span> GEORGE HENRY NETTLETON</p>

<p class="right fs80"><em>Cloth, 12mo, $1.50</em></p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>This work, of over three hundred pages exclusive of bibliography
and index, forms our first exhaustive study of English dramatic literature
for the years between 1642 and 1780. The plan of the work is
historical, with a grouping of plays and authors chiefly according to
the types of drama successively in vogue. A brief sketch of the
relations existing between Elizabethan and Restoration drama reveals
at the outset Professor Nettleton’s interest in the English
elements of our drama as distinct from various foreign influences.</p>

<p>“The reader will find in Professor Nettleton a safe guide and a
sound critic.”—<cite>London Spectator.</cite></p>

<p>“Good working text by an authority. Invaluable to students, as
it covers a period which has been so far only partly treated.”—<cite>A. L. A. Booklist.</cite></p>

<p>“A practical handbook for those who wish to gain by the least
possible expenditure of time and attention a clear idea of English
drama.”—<cite>Providence Journal.</cite></p>

<p>“The book is excellent.”—<cite>The Dial.</cite></p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>“Something more than a mere record of Laurence Sterne is
embodied within the covers of Professor Cross’s volume. It forms
a significant series of pictures of its time, and it sets before us the
character of many famous men of a famous period in English literature.”—<cite>Boston
Transcript.</cite></p>

<p>“Indispensable to all thorough students of English literature.”—<cite>Boston
Globe.</cite></p>

<p>“An admirable biography of the distinguished English novelist,
humorist, and clergyman, ... replete with information gleaned
from widely different sources and written in a style that holds the
reader’s interest throughout.”—<cite>Baltimore Sun.</cite></p>

<p>“One feels that it will remain standard and indispensable. It
has already supplanted all previous Lives of Sterne, and all future
estimates must reckon with this book. It was years a-making, and
it will take many years to make it obsolete.”—<cite>The Bookman.</cite></p>

<p>“An excellent biography, accurate in content, unusually full in
detail, well constructed, clear and pleasing in style.”—<cite>Chicago
